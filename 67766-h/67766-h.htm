<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is a fact that America in the early ages was one
of the inhabited parts of the earth. The Egyptians,
who were among the first of the peoples of the eastern
hemisphere to use letters and to write history, furnish
the earliest known account of the inhabitants of
this continent. It is also a truth that some ancient
geographers and philosophers, who had no personal
knowledge of the existence of a primitive people in
the western hemisphere, regarded the information recorded
by the Egyptians as fictitious and incredible.
When Columbus proposed to go to this inhabited
realm beyond the western ocean almost all the learned
men of Portugal and Spain opposed the undertaking as
visionary, and not a few of them asserted that the navigator’s
opinions were absurd, because, as they argued,
no one of all the seamen who had lived since the creation
of the world had discovered land beyond Hibernia.</p>

<p>The discovery of the continent and the subsequent
explorations of the Spaniards not only confuted the
fallacious arguments of the learned men of the middle
ages but confirmed the statements of the Egyptian
records descriptive of the civilization of the Atlantic
country. The tradition of the peopling of the continent
by the descendants of Euenor, the good man begotten
in the beginning from the ground, and of the
residence of celestial beings among the inhabitants
peculiarly confirms the account in the Bible of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
creation of the first man from the dust of the ground
and of his descendants having communications with
angels.</p>

<p>The asserted discovery of America by the Northmen
rests more upon conjecture than evidence. It
appears that Columbus was not the discoverer of the
continent, for it was seen in 1497 not only by Giovanni
Caboto but by the commander of the Spanish fleet
with whom Amerigo Vespucci first sailed to the New
World.</p>

<p>The land of Francesca, discovered by Verrazzano in
1524, it will be seen, was early possessed by the
French, who built a fort near the Indian village where
now is the city of New York, and called the surrounding
country La Terre d’Anormée Berge; a geographical
designation more significantly expressed in the
phraseology, The Land of the Palisades.</p>

<p>The writing of this work required the personal examination
of many old and rare books, manuscripts,
and maps, besides the perusal of a large number of
recent papers and publications relating to its subject.
The task further demanded a careful review and comparison
of the various statements of historical writers
concerning the voyages of the persons whom they believed
to have been the discoverers of certain parts of
the coast of America, between Baffin’s Bay and Tierra
del Fuego.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that some of the information contained
in the different works which I had examined
should be presented in the language of the writers or
in faithful translations so that the intended significance
of the information could be perceived by the reader.
I therefore have placed these <i>excerpta</i> before the
general reader and the critic in the belief that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
citations will be appreciated. They will at least show
my desire that the judgments of those who examine
them should not be biased by any conclusions of my own.</p>

<p>My researches were for the most part made in the
General Library of the State of New York, in Albany.
The generous personal interest taken by the State’s
distinguished librarian, Henry A. Homes, LL.D., in
placing before me the large number of works which I
desired to examine, was so constant and helpful that
it is a great pleasure for me to mention and acknowledge
his kind offices. I am also indebted to his
assistant, George Rogers Howell, for many official
courtesies. I also owe my thanks to George H.
Moore, LL.D., the erudite superintendent of the
Lenox Library, in the city of New York, to Frederick
Saunders, librarian of the Astor Library, to Jacob B.
Moore, librarian of the New York Historical Society,
and to Leopold Lindau, librarian of the American
Geographical Society. The offices of L’Abbé A. N.
Ménard, vicar of the parish of St. Roch, Paris,
France; of Pádre Antonio Ceriani, prefect of the Ambrosian
Library, Milan, Italy; of Jules Godeby, professor
of French literature in the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, Troy, New York; and of Dr. Titus Munson
Coan, of New York City, place me under many obligations
to these gentlemen. It is also a great pleasure
for me to acknowledge the generous favors of E.
Thompson Gale, of Troy, which permitted me to
accomplish the purposes that I had in view when,
eight years ago, I undertook my long-protracted task.
The kind offices of my friend, William H. Young, of
Troy, are also gratefully remembered.</p>

<h1>DISCOVERIES OF AMERICA.</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

</div>

<p>The oldest scriptures, sacred and profane, attest
the antiquity of the red race.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As early as the
antediluvian period this division of the human family
had taken possession of the islands and continent of
the western hemisphere, where it founded an empire,
the most famous and formidable of primeval times.
Great in political power, its commercial, agricultural,
and other economical interests were commensurably
vast and unparalleled. The skill of its architects and
engineers was exhibited in large and imposing edifices
and in extraordinary and extensive public works.
Aggressively belligerent, its armies overran parts of
Europe and Africa, exacting tribute, deposing and substituting
rulers.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards, in the sixteenth century, began
to explore the interior of the continent of America
for gold, silver, and precious stones, they found populated
provinces, great cities, temples, palaces, aqueducts,
canals, bridges, and causeways. The astonished
adventurers also discovered the vestiges of an aboriginal
people, among which were many massive tablets
of stone covered with columns of strange hieroglyphics
and antique images, picturing a past civilization for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the rise and growth of which modern archæologists
have not yet satisfactorily determined dates.</p>

<p>In the early ages of the world the Egyptians recorded
whatever they deemed important and worthy
of preservation concerning the principal inhabitants
of the globe. These inquisitive chroniclers of antediluvian
traditions placed in their archives some remarkable
information respecting the original people of the
western hemisphere. The historical value of this information
is enhanced by the fact that those parts of it
which seem to be the most improbable are supported
by similar statements in the Bible, while the less astounding
are verified by the discovery, on the continent
of the so-called New World, of such remains as
those which are said to have existed in the country west
of the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>About five hundred and seventy years before the
Christian era, Solon, the celebrated legislator of Greece,
visited Egypt, and while there became acquainted with
some of the erudite priests of the country.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When the
latter communicated to him what they had learned
from the records concerning the ancient peoples of
the earth, the sage of Greece was so deeply impressed
with the unquestionable value of this strange information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
that he committed it to writing, intending to use
it in an historical poem which he had undertaken to
compose.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> On his return to Athens he was not permitted
the leisure that was needed to complete his
agreeable task.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> After his death, the compilations he
had made in Egypt were, for a long time, preserved by
his descendants, and at last became the property of
Plato, the Greek philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The latter, when a
boy, had studiously perused his eminent ancestor’s
manuscript, and when he had reached the last years
of his scholarly life he could not disengage his
thoughts from the conviction that it was his personal
duty to publish its rare information.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In order, therefore,
to give publicity to Solon’s valuable compilations,
Plato, a short time before his own death, wrote that
part of the unfinished dialogue entitled “Critias, or the
Atlantic,” in which appears the earliest known account
of the ancient people of the western hemisphere.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>“When Solon interrogated the priests, who were
the most distinguished for their antiquarian knowledge,
he became aware that neither he nor any of the
Greeks knew much concerning the history of the first
ages of the world. On one occasion, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of inducing the priests to relate some of their ancient
traditions he began to narrate the early history of his
own country.... Thereupon one of the eldest
priests exclaimed: ‘Solon, Solon, you Greeks are but
children, and an aged Greek there is none!’ Solon,
hearing this, asked, ‘What do you mean?’ The
priest replied: ‘You are all youths in intelligence,
for you have no old beliefs transmitted by tradition, nor
any science hoary with age.... From the olden
time we have chronicled whatever has happened in
your country or in ours, or in any other region known
to us,—any action, noble or great or in any other way
remarkable,—and these records are preserved in our
temples, whereas you and other nations have but
lately been provided with letters and different things
required by states....</p>

<p>“‘Many and great exploits of your state, therefore,
are here recorded, and call forth our admiration; nevertheless,
there is one in particular, which in magnitude
and heroism surpasses them all. For these records
relate that your state once checked the advance of a
mighty force which threatened all Europe and Asia,
moving upon them from the Atlantic Ocean. For at
that time this ocean was navigable; and beyond the
strait [that of Gibraltar], which you in your language
call the Pillars of Hercules, was an island larger than
Libya [Africa] and Asia put together.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> At that time
sea-faring men could pass from it to the other islands,
and from them to the opposite continent, which extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
along the real ocean. For the sea [the Mediterranean]
inside the strait, which we have already
mentioned, is like a bay with a narrow entrance, but
the other sea is rightly called an ocean, and the land,
which entirely surrounds it, may truly and correctly be
called a continent. In this large Atlantic island a
mighty and wonderful confederacy of kings was
formed, which subdued the whole island and many
other islands and parts of the continent. Besides this
it extended its rule, on our side, over Libya as far as
Egypt, and over Europe as far as Tyrrhenia.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At
that time the united forces of this power undertook to
crush at one blow both your country and ours, and all
the other countries lying within the strait.’”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>“‘In the beginning the gods divided the whole
earth, here and there, into large and small portions, that
they might obtain temples and sacrifices. In this way
Poseidon received as his portion the Atlantic island,
and begat children by a mortal woman (ἐκ θνητῆς
γυναικὸς), and placed them on a part of the island
which we are about to describe.’”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Incredible as this information concerning the residence
of a person possessing a divine nature on the
earth and his matrimonial relationship with a woman
seems to be, there are some remarkable statements
in the traditions of the ancients respecting celestial
beings dwelling among men, and, by marriage with
their daughters, being the progenitors of an illustrious
offspring. The Hebrew patriarchs, it is said, had
personal communications with angels, at different times
and places. It is related that three, in human form,
partook of food given them by Abraham, under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
tree, in the plain of Mamre.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Herodotus was told,
by certain Egyptians, that “gods had been the rulers
of Egypt and had dwelt among men; and that one of
them always had the supreme power.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Moses, “who
was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,”
describing the people of the antediluvian world, writes:</p>

<p>“It happened, as men began to multiply on the face
of the earth and daughters were born to them, the
sons of the Elohim (‎‏בני האלהים‏‎) [literally, the sons
of the eminent or mighty ones] saw the daughters of
man (‎‏בנות האדם‏‎) that they were fair; then they
took for wives among them all whom they loved....
There were giants (‎‏נפלים‏‎) on the earth in
those days, and also after that the sons of the Elohim
went in unto the daughters of man and they bare
children to them, the same became heroes (‎‏גברים‏‎)
who were of old, men of name (‎‏אנשי שם‏‎).”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“‘Toward the sea, in the middle of the island, was
a plain,’ the priest continued, ‘which was very attractive
and fertile. About fifty stadia from the centre
of the plain was a mountain with sloping sides.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> On
this dwelt one of those men begotten from the ground
in the beginning (κατὰ ἀρχὰς ἐκ γῆς ἀνδρῶν γεγονότων),
Euenor by name.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He lived there, with his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Leucippe. They had an only daughter named Cleito.
When this girl reached womanhood, her father and
mother being dead, Poseidon fell in love with her and
made her his wife. He encircled the hill on which she
lived with alternate girdles of land and water, greater
and less, making two of land and three of water, each
uniformly distant from the centre of the island, in order
to render her habitation inaccessible to men, for at that
time ships and sea-faring were unknown. Also by his
divine power he beautifully adorned the centre of the
island, causing two fountains to shoot upward from
beneath the earth, one of cold and the other of hot
water, and making all kinds of food to grow abundantly
on the earth. He begat and raised ten male children,
twins, and divided the Atlantic island into ten parts.
He gave to the first-born of the eldest twins, his
mother’s habitation and the land surrounding it, this
being the largest and the best. He appointed him
king over the other children, making the latter princes,
and giving to each the control of many people and
extensive domains. He likewise gave names to all
of his offspring; to the eldest, the king, the name of
Atlas, in honor of whom both the island and the ocean
were called Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> To the twin born after him
(who received for his portion the extreme part of the
island toward the Pillars of Hercules as far as the
region now called in that country Gadeirica), he gave
the appellation, which we Greeks call Eumelus, but the
people of that country Gadeira.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He called the first of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the second-born twins, Ampheres, the second Eudæmon;
of the third pair, he called the first-born Mnesis,
and the second, Autochthon; of the fourth pair, the
first Elasippus, and the younger Mestor; and of the
fifth pair, to the first was given the name of Azaës, and
to the last, Diaprepes.</p>

<p>“‘For many generations these and their descendants
were the rulers and the inhabitants of the islands in
the ocean, and, as it has been said, they extended their
authority over all the country as far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia.
By far the most distinguished was the race of
Atlas; and the eldest king belonging to it always
handed down in succession the government to his
eldest son. All these kings in turn possessed immense
wealth, such as was never known to belong to royalty
or will be likely hereafter. They were provided with
all things which, in a city or elsewhere, are worth
having. Large revenues were received by them from
foreign countries under their rule, but the greatest resources
came from the island. First were such ores as
are dug in mines in a crude condition, or need to be
smelted, particularly the metal <i>orichalcum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which is
now known only by name, but formerly was of great
value. This was dug from the earth in many parts of
the island, being prized above all the metals then
known, except gold. The island also produced an
abundance of wood for building purposes, and furnished
food for wild and tame animals. Vast numbers
of elephants were on the island, for there was abundant
subsistence for all animals which feed in marshes and
along lakes, on mountains and plains, and likewise for
this animal, which by nature is the largest and most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
voracious of all.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And whatever fragrant plants the
earth produces, whether roots, or grasses, or woods, or
exuding gums, or flowers, or fruits, grew there and
were developed to perfection. The island besides produced
such cultivated fruits and dry edible fruits as we
use for food and call vegetables; also the fruits which
trees bear and are used for drinks, meats, and ointments;
and those also which have a hard shell, used
in sport and pleasure, that are collected with trouble,
together with dainty fruits for dessert, which provoke
the appetite or please the sick;—all these that once-existing
and tropic island, sacred and delightful, produced
in surprising and infinite quantities. Obtaining
all these from the soil, the inhabitants employed themselves
in building temples, royal palaces, harbors, and
wharves in all parts of the country, constructing them
as follows:</p>

<p>“‘First of all, the people residing in and about that
ancient metropolis bridged over those girdles of water,
making a causeway to and from the royal palace. In
this place, which had been the residence of the gods
and their ancestors, they, at the beginning, erected the
palace; and each [king] in turn, receiving it from his
predecessor, and further embellishing the ornamental
parts, continually surpassed the one before him, until
they made the building very attractive to the sight, on
account of its size and the beauty of its elaborations.
They dug a canal, beginning at the sea, three plethra<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
broad, a hundred feet deep, and fifty stadia in length,
to the outermost girdle, and thus made a channel to it
from the sea as into a harbor, by enlarging its mouth
sufficiently to admit the largest vessels. Besides this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
they separated by aqueducts the girdles of land which
separated those of water, so that a trireme<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> could be
taken from one girdle of water to another, arching the
girdles of land to allow a water-way beneath them; for
the banks of the girdles of land rose to a height considerably
above the water. And the greatest of these
girdles into which the sea flowed was three stadia in
width, and the girdle of land next to it was of the same
width. The second girdle of water was two stadia in
width and the second girdle of land the same. The
last girdle of water, environing the centre of the island,
was only one stadium wide, and the island, on
which the king’s palace stood, had a diameter of
five stadia. This island, as well as the girdles of
land, and the bridge (which was a plethron in width),
they inclosed on the sides with stone walls, erecting
towers and gates at intervals on the aqueducts where
the water passed through [the girdles of land]. The
stone for the walls they quarried within the limits of
the island, both in the centre, and inside and outside
the girdles; one kind of it was white, a second black,
a third red; and by thus quarrying they made at the
same time openings which served for two docks, having
likewise a covering of rock. Of the buildings, some
were of plain structure, while others they built of a
composite style of architecture, using the different
kinds of stone as pleased them most, thus realizing a
pleasure becoming their natures. And they covered
the whole circuit of the wall round the extreme outer
girdle with bronze, applying it as they would plaster.
The next wall inside of it they covered with melted tin,
and the wall round the citadel with <i>orichalcum</i> that has
a fiery resplendence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“‘Further, the royal palace within the citadel was
constructed in the following manner: In the centre
of it a temple was erected, difficult of access, sacred
to Cleito and Poseidon, surrounded by an inclosure of
gold; for on this spot they begat and raised the race
of the ten kings, and where also their descendants,
making annual collections from all the ten allotments,
offered seasonable sacrifices to each one.</p>

<p>“‘The temple of Poseidon was a stadium in length,
three plethra in breadth, and of a proportionate height,
having a somewhat barbaric appearance. All the outside
of the temple, except the pinnacles, they lined
with silver, but the pinnacles they covered with gold.
Respecting the interior, the ceiling was wholly of ivory,
variegated with gold and <i>orichalcum</i>, and all the other
parts, the walls, the pillars, and the pavements, they
covered with <i>orichalcum</i>. They also placed in the
temple golden statues. The one of the god stood in a
chariot driving with reins six-winged horses. It was
of such size that the head of the god touched the
ceiling, and surrounding the statue were a hundred
nereids on dolphins; for the people of that day thought
that this was their number. The temple also contained
many other statues dedicated to private persons. On
the outside of the temple golden images were also
placed of all the men and women that were descended
from the ten kings, and many other large statues, both
of kings and of private people, both from the metropolis
and from the foreign countries over which the kings
had dominion. There was also an altar, in size and
elaboration corresponding to these ornaments; and
there were palaces also whose grandeur was in
keeping with the greatness of the empire and also
with the splendor of the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“‘They had fountains from cold and hot springs of
which there were many, the water being suited in
every way to their use on account of its sweetness and
purity. Around these springs they made their residences
and well-watered plantations, together with
their reservoirs, some open to the heavens, but the
others, for use in winter, roofed over for warm baths.
The kings’ bathing-houses and those of private persons
were separated, as well as those of the women.
There were others for horses and other draught cattle,
each provided with the requisite means of cleanliness.
The stream flowing from these they conducted to the
grove of Poseidon, where there were all kinds of trees
reaching a wonderful height on account of the fertility
of the soil, and then led it away by aqueducts to the
outer girdles of water. There they also erected a
large number of temples, dedicated to many different
gods, and many gardens and gymnasia, one for men,
and others separately for horses, on the two girdles of
land. To test the speed of the horses there was a
race-course in the middle of the largest girdle of land,
a stadium in width, that extended around its entire circumference.
Around it on all sides were barracks for
the household troops, corresponding to their number.
To the more faithful of these troops quarters were
assigned on the smaller girdle of land closer to the
citadel, while those who excelled all the others in loyalty
had quarters given them within the citadel, near
the residences of the kings. The docks were filled
with triremes and the equipments for triremes; and
the triremes were all adequately provided with them.
These were the arrangements for the protection of the
palace of the kings. On crossing the three outer harbors
one found a wall which extended entirely around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the island, beginning at the sea, everywhere fifty
stadia distant from the greatest girdle and harbor, and
inclosed the entrance to the canal and the entrance to
the sea. The whole of this part of the girdle of land
was covered with many and densely-built dwellings.
The canal and the largest harbor were filled with
vessels and traders, coming from all parts, and these,
on account of their number, made a babel of voices, a
commotion, and a din all through the day and the
night.</p>

<p>“‘We have now related from memory a description
of the city and its ancient habitations; now we must
attempt to describe the nature of the other parts of
the country and the employment of the people. First,
then, the whole region was said to be exceedingly
high and precipitous toward the sea, and the plain,
encircling the city, surrounded by mountains sloping
down to the sea, being level and smooth, extended
in one direction three thousand stadia, and the central
part, from the sea, more than two thousand stadia.
And this part of the island extended toward the south,
in an opposite direction from the north. The mountains
around it were, at that time, also celebrated,
exceeding in number, size, and attractiveness all those
of the present day; having on them many hamlets
together with villages, as well as rivers, lakes, and
marshes, furnishing ample supplies of food for all cattle,
both tame and wild; with timber of different kinds and
in great quantity for every special purpose. The plain,
by nature, being as described, was improved in the
following way by many kings through a long course of
time: It was almost square in extent, generally
straight and oblong, and where it terminated they
bounded it by digging a canal around it. Concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the depth, breadth, and length of which for a public
work, besides other concomitant undertakings, we can
scarcely believe what was said, still we must tell what
we learned. The canal was excavated to the depth of
a plethrum, and the breadth was a stadium in every
part, the entire excavation round the plain being ten
thousand stadia in length. This canal, receiving the
water of the streams coming from the mountains, conducted
it all around the plain and near to the city, and
finally to the sea. From above, likewise, straight
canals were cut about a hundred feet broad along the
plain, back into the canal near the sea; distant from
one another about one hundred stadia; and it was by
these canals that timber from the mountains was
brought to the city, and on which the rest of the
shipping trade was done; transverse canals of communication
being cut into the others and toward the
city. Their harvest they gathered twice in a year; in
winter availing themselves of the rains, and in summer
irrigating the land from the canals.</p>

<p>“‘It was ordered for the men on the plain fit for military
service that each individual leader should have an
allotment of land; each allotment amounting in extent
to a hundred stadia; the whole number of allotments
being sixty thousand. It is said that many men from
the mountains and other parts of the country were
assigned, according to their dwellings and villages, certain
tracts by their respective leaders. Each leader
was required to furnish for war the sixth part of a
war-chariot (to make the number of ten thousand), two
riding horses, and a two-horse chariot without a
driver’s seat, having a mounted charioteer to guide
the horses, with another rider to dismount and fight at
the side of them; also two heavy-armed men, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
archers, two slingers, three light-armed soldiers, the
same number of stone-shooters and javelin-men, besides
four seamen to make up the crews of one thousand
two hundred vessels. Thus were the military
affairs of this city arranged. Respecting those of the
nine other allotments, there were different regulations,
which it would be too tedious to narrate.</p>

<p>“‘The following were the systems of official services
and honors: Each of the ten kings ruled supreme
over the people and the laws in his own allotment
and over his own city, constraining and punishing
whom he pleased.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> As the law was handed down to
them, the government and commonwealth in each
allotment were regulated by the injunctions of Poseidon.
Inscriptions [of this law] were made by the first
[kings] on a column of <i>orichalcum</i> which was placed
in the centre of the island, in the temple of Poseidon,
where the kings consulted together every fifth year,
(which they afterward changed to every sixth year,)
each king representing at these meetings the entire
kingdom and its subdivisions. The kings, when they
were assembled, deliberated on matters respecting the
common weal, and inquired what transgressions each
had committed, and each respectively rendered his
decision. Before they sat in judgment they gave one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
another pledges, according to the following custom:
The ten, when they were assembled in the temple,
after invoking the god to receive their sacrifice propitiously,
went swordless, with staves and nooses, among
the bulls grazing within the temple inclosure, and the
bull they took they brought to the column and slaughtered
it, the head of the bull being under the inscriptions.
Besides the laws on the column, there was a
malediction written containing denunciations of evil on
the disobedient. When, therefore, in compliance with
their laws, they sacrificed and burned all the limbs of
the bull, they filled a goblet with the blood of the
animal, and threw the remainder into the fire, in order
to purify the column. Afterward dipping from the
goblet with golden cups, they poured libations of
blood on the fire, and swore to do justice according to
the laws on the column, to punish any one who had
previously transgressed them, besides swearing that
they themselves would never afterward willingly transgress
the inscribed laws, or rule or obey any ruler
governing otherwise than according to his father’s laws.
Then after invoking these denunciations on themselves
and their descendants, and after drinking from the cup
and depositing it in the temple of the god, and sitting
the necessary time at supper, they, as soon as it was
dark and the fire of the sacrifice had ceased to burn,
dressed themselves in beautiful dark-blue robes, and
sat down on the ground, near the embers of the sacrifice,
over which they had sworn. All the fire in the
temple having been extinguished for the night, they
then mutually judged one another respecting any accusation
of transgressing the laws. After their acts of
judgment were ended, and daylight had come, they
inscribed their decisions on a golden tablet and deposited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
it and their dresses in the temple as memorials.
There were also many other special laws respecting
the privileges of the kings. The principal ones were
that they should never wage war upon one another,
that all should lend their aid when any attempt was
made in their cities to destroy the royal race, that they
should consult together as their ancestors had done respecting
the right course to be pursued in war and in
other matters, and that they should allot the government
of the empire to the Atlantic race. They did
not allow the king, however, any authority to put to
death any of his kinsmen, unless the execution was
approved by more than five of the ten.’”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The priest also related that it was “about nine
thousand years ago that war was proclaimed between
those dwelling outside the Pillars of Hercules and all
those within them.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Athens “was the leader of the
latter people and directed the operations of the war,
and the kings of the Atlantic island were the commanders
of the forces of the former.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>“‘But in a later age,’ said the priest, ‘by extraordinary
earthquakes and deluges, bringing destruction in
a single day and night, the whole of your formidable
race was at once sunk under the earth, and the
Atlantic island in like manner plunged beneath the sea
and concealed from view; therefore that sea is, at
present, neither passable nor to be traced out, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
blocked up with a great depth of mud made by the
sunken island.’”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The history of the Atlantic people as it was known
to the ancient Egyptians ends with this catastrophe.
The inference of the priest that the mud of the submerged
island made the Atlantic impassable is seemingly
an assertion without any basis of fact. Had he
said that the submergence of some of the islands west
of the Pillars of Hercules obliterated the marked sea-path
between the continents of the two hemispheres,
this statement would have strictly accorded with what
he had said before, that “sea-faring men, at that time,
could pass from it [the Atlantic island] to the other
islands, and from them to the opposite continent.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The disappearance of the islands, in sight of which seamen
had steered their galleys, at once isolated the
peoples of the two hemispheres. Thus it happened,
in the course of centuries, that the aborigines of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
America passed out of the recollection of the inhabitants
of the so-called Old World as an early-known
people.</p>

<p>The writer of the first book of the Bible relates
that when “Yahveh saw the wickedness of man was
great upon the earth and every imagination of the
thoughts of his heart only evil continually, ...
it repented him of having made man on the earth,
and he was grieved in his heart. And Yahveh said,
‘I will exterminate man whom I have created from
the surface of the ground.’”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The information contained
in these words of the learned Hebrew so closely
correspond to that imparted to Solon by the Egyptian
priest concerning the subsequent degeneracy of the
primitive people of the earth, that it would seem as
if it had been derived from the same source. “‘For
many generations,’ said the priest, ‘so long as the
god-nature continued in them, they remained obedient
to the laws and were happily influenced by it. But
when the divine nature became extinct by the dominance
and constant ascendency of the human, and the
habits of men overpowered them, ... they deported
themselves in an unbecoming way....
Therefore, Zeus, the god of gods, who rules justly
and searches out such things, perceiving an illustrious
people miserably depraved, and intending to inflict
punishment on them that they might become better
fitted to command their appetites and passions, collected
all the gods into their own most holy habitation,
which, being in the centre of the universe, commands
a view of all things having a part in generation; and
having assembled them, he said....’”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>An inscription on the interior walls of the tomb of
Seti I. of Egypt contains a statement concerning a
council of the gods held to consider what punishment
should be visited upon the depraved descendants of
the god Râ, which is similar to the declaration of the
last clause of Plato’s unfinished dialogue.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Lenormant,
commenting upon the information contained in the
inscription, remarks:</p>

<p>“The Egyptians admitted a destruction of the primitive
men by the gods on account of their rebellion and
sins. This event was recorded in a chapter of the sacred
books of Tahout,—certain hermetic books of the Egyptian
priesthood,—that had been graven on the walls of
one of the most isolated rooms of the burial crypts of
King Seti I., at Thebes. The text of it has been published
and translated by Edward Naville.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>“The scene is placed at the end of the reign of the
god Râ.... Incensed by the wickedness and
the crimes of the men whom he had begotten, the god
summons the other gods to consult with them in the
utmost secrecy, ‘in order that mankind might not
know it, and that their hearts might not be dismayed.’</p>

<p>“Said Râ to Noun: ‘Thou, the eldest of the gods,
of whom I am sprung, and you, ancient gods, behold
the men who have been begotten by me. They speak
words against me. Tell me what you would do in this
crisis. Behold, I have waited, and I have not destroyed
them before having heard your counsel.’”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Singular as the fact may seem, the state, polity,
and genius of the people of the western hemisphere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
described in the records of Egypt reappear in the
strange features of the civilization of Mexico, and in the
vestiges of its aborigines, which amazed the Spaniards
who accompanied Hernando Cortes into the interior
of the country, in the early part of the sixteenth century.
The remarkable accounts given by Bernal Diaz
and other contemporary writers respecting the people,
the kings, the cities, the palaces, the temples, and the
public works seen by the Spanish invaders, verify, in
many ways, the declarations of the Egyptian priests
concerning the Atlantic race.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>For centuries after the disappearance of the islands
lying in the ocean west of the Pillars of Hercules, the
wide expanse of water, dashing its foaming surges on
the shores of the continents of the two hemispheres,
was not only unexplored but was deemed impassable.
Superstition filled its misty distances with frightful
chimeras and geographical absurdities. About the
beginning of the Middle Ages the vikings of Northern
Europe were venturing across the North Sea in their
single-masted, many-oared galleys. Until this time
the superstitious seamen of Scandinavia had not attempted
to sail beyond the sight of land to any great distance.
Their first lessons in navigating the narrow
expanse of the North Sea were taken when their
boats were unexpectedly carried away from the rugged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
coast of Norway by tempestuous winds to the Hetland<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and Fer öe<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (Far islands). Whatever fears of
permanent exile on these unexplored islands may at
first have alarmed the deported Northmen, these
were dispelled by the cheering suggestion that when
the wind blew from the west they could return to their
own country. As soon as the wind blew eastwardly
they put to sea. Using their sails and oars they safely
reached the western shore of Scandinavia. Frequent
experiences of this kind in time emboldened the
Norwegian seamen to undertake voyages to the
westward islands in search of booty. Having no
compass to guide their galleys thither, they carried
with them hawks or ravens, and when uncertain respecting
the course of their vessels, they let loose a
cast of these birds, which instinctively flew to the
nearest land. Thitherward they steered, and finding
that it was their destination or not, they secured whatever
plunder they could and departed. Not unfrequently
the vessels of the Norse sea-kings were lost
in storms on the wild waters of the Atlantic, or
wrecked on the inhospitable shores of remote islands.
It is said that Naddoddr, a Norwegian pirate, was
drifted in his ship by an adverse wind, in 860, to Iceland,
which he called Sneeland (Snowland).<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
also related that when the famous viking, Floki, was
lost in his vessel in stormy weather, between the
islands of Faroe and Sneeland, in 865, he let fly three
ravens, one of which flew back to the Faroe islands,
the second returned to the ship, and the third winged
its way toward the more northerly island which the
perplexed Northman was seeking. This sturdy seaman
described the new country as volcanic and sterile,
glacial and cold, and appropriately called it Island
(Iceland). His companions, however, reported that
they had found it to have a delightful climate and a
fertile soil. One, wishing to describe its general fruitfulness
in a more attractive way, averred that “milk
dropped from every plant and butter from every
twig.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In a short time a course to Iceland was
marked out by the early rovers of the North Sea, who,
before the close of the ninth century, planted a colony
on the bleak coast of this icy island, the most westerly
land hitherto discovered by the fearless seamen of
Scandinavia.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>But Iceland did not long remain the most remote
part of the western world known to the people of
Europe. Gunnbjörn, a Norwegian, driven westward in
his ship beyond Iceland, in a storm, in 876, descried
land looming up along the western horizon. In the
latter part of the tenth century, Eric the Red, whom
the public assembly of Iceland had declared an outlaw,
determined to go in search of the land seen by Gunnbjörn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
He sailed from Iceland about the year 981, and
came in sight of the coast of Greenland, at a place
called Midjökul.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He then steered southward to see
whether the country were habitable. He passed the
first winter near the middle of the site of the eastern
settlement (<i>eystri bygd</i>).<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In the following summer
he reached the western uninhabited region (<i>vestri
ubygd</i>),<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and gave names to many places. As soon as
the ice disappeared, at the close of the second winter,
and the sea was again navigable, he returned to Iceland,
and called the country which he had explored
Graenland (Greenland), “because” he said, “people
will be influenced to immigrate to it, if the land bears
an attractive name.” Among those whom Eric induced
to return with him as colonists to Greenland
was a Norwegian, named Herjulf. Thirty-five ships
(<i>skipa</i>) filled with emigrants set sail from Iceland for
the newly explored country, but only fourteen of the
vessels reached the places where the colonists were to
dwell. Eric the Red settled at Brattahlid, and Herjulf
erected his house on a cape called Herjulfsnes (Herjulf’s
nose, or promontory).<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> “This was fifteen winters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
before Christianity was established by law in Iceland.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Among the traditions preserved of the voyages of
the Northmen in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
centuries, there are several that have caused considerable
controversy respecting the historical and
geographical value of the information contained in
them; for a number of eminent writers have made
use of this information to show that the Northmen
were the first discoverers of America and the explorers
of a large part of the eastern coast of the
continent.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Although these sagas or legends of Iceland
were unrecorded for several centuries, the manuscripts
which now contain them are assumed to have
been written in a manner so precise that translations
of their text are presented to prove that the Norse
vikings not only made frequent voyages to America,
but that they have left definite and reliable information
respecting the parts of the coast visited by them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Other distinguished writers consider these traditions as
too mythical and vague to be deemed valuable, either
historically or geographically, and argue that what is
thought to describe the physical features and productions
of parts of the present territory of the eastern
coast of the United States describes the topography
and fruits of Greenland. A brief narration of the most
important particulars of the voyages of several of the
Northmen who have been regarded, as the first discoverers
of parts of the continent of America, will suffice
to show the grounds upon which rest many of the
arguments that have been advanced to support the
opinion that these persons had landed upon its shores
and explored a great extent of its Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>It is said in the saga of Eric the Red and of the
Greenlanders,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> that when Herjulf sailed, in the spring
of 985, from Iceland to Greenland, his son Bjarni was
in Norway. When the latter, in the following summer
returned to Iceland, and learned that his father had
emigrated to the country recently explored by Eric
the Red, he determined to sail to it and pass the winter
with his father, as had been his custom for many years.
He evidently had some misgivings respecting the success
of the contemplated voyage, for he said to his
companions: “Our going there will be devoid of
common-sense, since not one of us has traversed the
Greenland Sea.” “Nevertheless,” as the tradition
runs, “as soon as they had fitted for the voyage, they
intrusted themselves to the ocean, and made sail three
days, until the land passed out of their sight from the
water. But then the bearing winds ceased to blow,
and northern breezes and a fog succeeded. Then they
were drifted about for many days and nights, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
knowing whither they tended. After this the light of
the sun was seen, and they were able to survey the
regions of the sky. Now they carried sail, and steered
this day before they beheld land.” They sailed near
to it, and “soon saw that the country was not mountainous,
but covered with trees and diversified with
little hills. They left the land on their larboard side,
and let the stern turn from the shore. Then they
sailed two days before they saw another land [or
region].... They then approached it, and
saw that it was level and covered with trees. Then,
the favorable wind having ceased blowing, the sailors
said that it seemed to them that it would be well to
land there, but Bjarni was unwilling to do so....
He bade them make sail, which was done. They
turned the prow from the land, and sailed out into the
open sea, where for three days they had a favorable
south-southwest wind. They saw a third land [or
region], but it was high and mountainous and covered
with glaciers.... They did not lower sail, but
holding their course along the shore, they found it to
be an island. Again they turned the stern against the
land, and made sail for the high sea, having the same
wind, which gradually increasing, Bjarni ordered the
sails to be shortened, forbidding the use of more
canvas than the ship and her outfit could conveniently
bear. Thus they sailed for four days, when they saw a
fourth land” [or region], which was Greenland, where
Bjarni found his father.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Bjarni’s discoveries, it is said, were often the subject
of conversation among the Northmen. It is
further related that Leif, the son of Eric the Red, purchased
Bjarni’s ship and set sail in it with thirty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
men from Brattahlid about the year 1000 to seek new
lands. Nothing is told in the tradition concerning the
direction in which these Northmen sailed, only that
“they first came to the land [or region] last seen by
Bjarni. They steered toward the shore, cast anchor,
put out the boat, and went on land, where they saw no
herbage. The whole country was filled with high icy
mountains, and from the sea all the way to the icy
mountains was a plain of flat stones.” Leif called the
region Helluland.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>When Leif and his companions departed from
Helluland, it is related that they “put out to sea and
found another land [or region]. This was a level
country and covered with trees.” Leif named it
Markland.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="caption">FIELD OF VOYAGES TO AMERICA.</p>
<p class="caption">ON MERCATOR’S PROJECTION.</p>
</div>

<p>As related in the saga, when they departed from
Markland, “they sailed on the high sea, having a
northeast wind, and were two days at sea before they
saw land. They steered toward it and touched the
island lying before the north part of the land. When
they went on land they surveyed it, for by good fortune
the weather was serene. They found the grass
sprinkled with dew, and it happened by chance that
they touched the dew with their hands and carried them
to their mouths and perceived that it had a sweet taste
which they had not before noticed. Then they returned
to the ship and sailed through a bay lying between
the island and a tongue of land running toward
the north. Steering a course to the west shore, they
passed the tongue of land. Here when the tide ebbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
there were very narrow shoals. When the ship got
aground there were shallows of great extent between
the vessel and the receded sea. So great was the
desire of the men to go on land that they were unwilling
to stay on board until the returning tide floated
the ship. They went ashore at a place where a river
flowed out from a lake. When the tide floated the
ship, they took the boat and rowed to the vessel and
brought her into the river and then into the lake.
Here they anchored, carried the luggage from the
ship, and built dwellings. Afterward they held a consultation
and resolved to remain at this place during
the winter. Then they erected large buildings. There
were not only many salmon in the river but also in the
lake and of a larger size than they had before seen.
So great was the fertility of the soil that they were
led to believe that cattle would not be in want of food
during winter, or that wintry coldness would prevail, or
the grass wither much.”</p>

<p>While the Northmen were passing the winter on
the shore of the unnamed lake, it happened one evening
that a Southern man, named Tyrker, did not
return with those who had been out exploring the
country. Those who went to search for the absent
man met him returning to the quarters. They were
surprised when he told them that he had found wine-wood
and wine-berries (<i>vinvid ok vinber</i>). “Is this
true, my teacher?” asked Leif. “It is really true,”
Tyrker replied, “for where I was brought up there was
not wanting either wine-wood or wine-berries.” They
passed this night in sleep, but on the following morning
Leif said to the men: “Two things are now to be
done on alternate days, gathering wine-berries or hewing
wine-wood and felling trees, (<i>lesa vinber, edr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
höggva vinvid ok fella mörkina</i>,) with which my ships
should be loaded.” Having loaded the ship and the
spring approaching they prepared to depart. To designate
the productions of the region, Leif called it Vinland
(Wine-land). They then put to sea and had a
favorable wind until they came in sight of Greenland.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>As a number of writers have assumed that the region
of Vinland, where Leif and his companions wintered,
was the country adjacent Mount Hope Bay, in
Rhode Island, the following description of a part of the
east coast of Greenland, given by Captain W. A.
Graah, who was sent there, in 1828, by the Danish
government to obtain information respecting the site
of the eastern settlement (<i>eystri bygd</i>), will likely afford
grounds for a more plausible conjecture that Vinland
was a region in Greenland: “August 30 [1829].—The
place we now were at was the Ekallumiut [between
the sixty-third and sixty-fourth parallel of north
latitude], so often mentioned. The cove, the length
of which is between one and two cable-lengths, has on
both sides of it, but particularly on the eastern, fields
of considerable extent, covered with dwarf-willows,
juniper-berry, black crake-berry, and whortleberry
heath, the first-named growing to the height of two
feet, and the whole interspersed with a good many
patches of a fine species of grass, which, however, was
very much burnt by the heat of the sun, except in
the immediate vicinity of the brooks and rivulets that,
in great number, ran down the sides of the hills, and
intersected the level land in every direction. At the
the bottom of the cove stretches an extensive valley,
through which runs a stream abounding in char, [a
species of salmon,] and having its source in the glaciers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of which several gigantic arms reach down into the
valley from the height in the background. On the
banks of this brook the grass grew luxuriantly; but
it was far from being, at many places, of a height fit for
mowing, so that even this spot, where grass was more
abundant than anywhere else perhaps along the whole
coast, does not seem calculated to furnish winter
fodder for any considerable number of cattle. Various
flowers, among which the sweet-smelling lychnis,
everywhere adorned the fields.... At this
really beautiful spot, the natives of the country round
assemble for a few days during their brief summer, to
feast upon the char that are to be got here in great
plenty and of a great size, the black crake-berry and
angelica, and to lay in a stock of them for winter use,
and give themselves up to mirth and merry-making.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It is further related, in the saga, concerning Vinland,
that “the days are more equal there than in
Greenland or Iceland; there the sun sets at eykt time
(<i>eyktar-stad</i>, 3:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>), and rises at day-meal time
(<i>dagmála-stad</i>, breakfast-time), on the shortest day.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>As there is no reliable information to indicate that
the Northmen of the tenth century had any instruments
by which they could accurately measure the
changing spaces of day and night, or that their observations
of the sun gave them the knowledge of
astronomical time, an attempt to elucidate the exact
duration of the shortest day in Vinland from the vague<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
signification of the words <i>eyktar-stad</i> and <i>dágmála-stad</i>
would consequently be futile and unsatisfactory. Nevertheless
a number of scholars have attempted to determine
the length of the shortest day at the place
where the Northmen built their winter-quarters. Some
have given the day a measurement of six hours, others
seven, eight, and nine hours.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> These different lengths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the day involve the inference that Vinland was somewhere
between the forty-first and sixty-first parallels
of north latitude.</p>

<p>It is related in another saga or legend that Vinland
was visited in the eleventh century by other Northmen.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Among the number were Thorfinn Karlsefne, Snorro
Thorbrandson, Bjarni Grimolfson, and Thorhall Gamlason.
It is said that the three ships which departed
from the western settlement, in the spring of 1007, had
on board one hundred and forty men (<i>40 manna ok
hundrad</i>). After sailing two days southward from
Bjanneyjar they reached Helluland. “Thence they
sailed two days, and turned from the south to the
southeast,” and came to Markland.</p>

<p>When the Northmen departed from Markland, it is
said in the saga that “they then sailed far to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
southward along the coast and came to a promontory.
The land lay on the right and had a long sandy beach.
They rowed to it and found on a tongue of land the
keel of a ship. They called this point of land Kjalarnes
(Keel cape), and the beach Furdustrandir (Long
Strand), for it took a long time to sail by it. Then the
coast became sinuous. They then steered the ship
into an inlet. King Olaf Tryggvason had given Leif
two Scotch people, a man named Haki and a woman
named Hekja. They were swifter than animals. These
persons were in the ship with Karlsefne. When they
had sailed past Furdustrandir they put these Scots
ashore and ordered them to run to the south of the
country and explore it, and return within three days....
They were absent the designated time.
When they returned, one brought a bunch of wine-berries
(<i>vinberja köngul</i>), the other an ear of wheat
(<i>hveitiax nysaid</i>).<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When they were taken on board,
the ship sailed farther. They came into a bay, where
there was an island around which flowed rapid currents
that suggested the name which they gave it, Straumey
(Stream island). There were so many eider ducks on
the island that one could hardly walk about without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
stepping on their eggs. They called this place Straumfjörd
(Stream inlet). They took the cargo from the
ship and made preparations to remain there. They
had with them different kinds of cattle. They undertook
nothing but the exploration of the land. Without
having provided food beforehand they sustained themselves
there during the winter. In the summer the
fishing was not good and they were in want of provisions.
Thorhall the hunter disappeared. They had
previously prayed to God to give them food, but they
were not supplied as quickly as they thought their
hunger demanded. They searched for Thorhall for
three days. At last they found him lying on the top
of a rock, looking up at the sky, gasping and muttering.
They asked him why he was there. He said that
his presence there should not trouble them. They
prevailed on him to return home with them. A whale
was stranded there, and they found it and cut it up.
No one knew what kind of a whale it was, and when
the cook prepared a part of it for them, they ate it and
all were made sick. Then Thorhall said: ‘The red-bearded
[Thor, the god of thunder,] was more helpful
than your Christ; this [the whale meat] I have received
for my hymns which I sing of Thor, my protector;
seldom has he deserted me.’ When they
heard this assertion, they cast the remainder of the
whale into the sea and resigned themselves to the
care of God. Then the weather favored them so that
they were able to row out to fish, and thereafter they
were not in want of food, for wild game was caught
on land and fish in the sea, and eggs were collected on
the island....</p>

<p>“It is said that Thorhall resolved to go northward
along Furdustrandir to explore Vinland, but Karlsefne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
determined to sail southward along the coast. Thorhall
fitted out his vessel under the island, having not more
than nine men to join him, for all the others went with
Karlsefne. Now when Thorhall carried water to his
ship, he sang these verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘People told me when I came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hither, all would be so fine;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Have I quaffed one drop of wine.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“When they were about to depart and had hoisted
sail, Thorhall again sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Let our trusty band</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Far from Fatherland.’ ...</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It is now to be told of Karlsefne that he with
Snorro and Bjarni and their people sailed southward
along the coast. They sailed a long time until they
came to a river, which ran out from the land and
through a lake into the sea. The river was quite shallow,
and no ship could enter it without high water.
Karlsefne sailed with his people into its mouth and
called the place Hóp (<i>ok kölludu i Hópi</i>).<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They
found fields of wild wheat (<i>sjálfsana hveitiakra</i>) where
the ground was low, and wine-wood where it was
higher.... There was a great number of all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of wild animals in the woods. They remained at this
place a half-month and enjoyed themselves, but did not
find any thing novel. They had their cattle with them.
Early one morning, when they were viewing the
country, they saw a great number of skin boats on the
sea.... The people in them rowed nearer
and with curiosity gazed at them.... These
people were swart (<i>svartir</i>) and ugly, and had coarse
hair, large eyes, and broad cheeks. They remained a
short time and watched Karlsefne’s people. They then
rowed away to the southward beyond the cape.</p>

<p>“Karlsefne and his people had erected their dwellings
above the lake. Some of the houses were near
the water and others were farther away. They remained
here during the winter.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> There was no snow,
and their cattle subsisted on the grass.”</p>

<p>It is further related that when spring drew near the
natives again visited the Northmen and trafficked with
them. “The people preferred red cloth, and for this
they gave skins and all kinds of furs. They also wanted
to purchase swords and spears, but Karlsefne and
Snorro would not sell them any weapons. For a
whole skin the Skraelings (<i>Skraelingar</i>) took a piece
of red cloth a span long, and bound it around their
heads.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In this way they bartered for a time. Then
the cloth began to diminish, and Karlsefne and his men
cut it into small strips not wider than one’s finger, and
still the Skraelings gave as much for these as they
had for the larger pieces, and often more. “It happened
that a bull, which Karlsefne had with him, ran
out from the wood and bellowed loudly. This frightened
the Skraelings so much that they rushed to their boats
and rowed away to the southward around the coast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Three weeks afterward a large number of Skraelings
returned in their boats uttering loud cries. “Karlsefne’s
men took a red shield and held it toward
them. The Skraelings leaped from their boats and
attacked them. Many missiles fell among them, for
the Skraelings used slings (<i>valslöngur</i>). Karlsefne’s
men saw that they had raised on a pole something
resembling an air-filled bag of a blue color. They
hurled this at Karlsefne’s party, and when it fell to
the ground it exploded with a loud noise. This frightened
Karlsefne and his men so much that they ran
and fell back to the river, for it seemed to them that the
Skraelings were inclosing them on all sides. They did
not stop until they reached a rocky place where they
stoutly resisted their assailants. Freydis [the wife of
Thorvard] came out, and seeing Karlsefne’s people retreating,
cried out: ‘Why do you run, stout men as
you are, before these miserable wretches, whom I
thought you could knock down as you do cattle! If I
had weapons I know that I could fight better than
you!’ They did not heed her words. Freydis then
attempted to keep up with them but could not. She
followed them to the woods. The Skraelings pursued
her. She found a dead man in the way. It was Thorbrand
Snorrason. A flat stone was sticking in his
head. His sword was by his side. She grasped it
and prepared to defend herself. The Skraelings came
toward her. She exposed her bosom and struck
her breast with the sword. The Skraelings were
frightened and ran to their boats and rowed away.
Karlsefne and his men then came and praised her
courage. Karlsefne lost two men but the Skraelings
many more....</p>

<p>“Karlsefne and his men now perceived that notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the country was fruitful they would be
exposed to many dangerous incursions of its inhabitants
if they should remain in it. They therefore determined
to depart and return to their own land. They
sailed northward along the coast and found five
Skraelings clothed in skins sleeping on the sea-shore.
They had with them vessels containing marrow mixed
with blood. Karlsefne’s men believed that they had
been banished from the country and they killed them.
After that they came to a cape and there were many
wild animals on it.... Then they reached
Straum fjörd, where there was an abundance of every
thing which they desired. It is said by some that
Bjarni and Gudrid remained behind with one hundred
men, and did not go farther, but that Karlsefne and
Snorro went southward and forty men with them, and
that they were not longer in Hóp than two months,
and that they returned from there the same summer....
They inspected the mountains at Hóp, which
they thought belonged to a range which extended in
two directions to the same distance from Straum
fjörd. The third winter they were in Straum fjörd....
Snorro, the son of Karlsefne, was born here
the first autumn, and he was three years old when
they went away from Vinland. When they sailed from
Vinland they had a south wind and came to Markland.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The Northmen it seems continued their visits to
Vinland as late as the fourteenth century. In the geographical
treatise of Adam of Bremen, written in 1073,
the author says that it was told him by Sveyn Estrithson,
King of Denmark, that Vinland was an island:
“Moreover he said that an island had been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
by many in that ocean, which is called Vinland,
because vines grow spontaneously there, producing excellent
wine. For that fruits abound there not having
been sown, we are assured not by any vague rumor
but by the trustworthy report of the Danes.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The island of Vinland is described in an old geographical
document as lying on the opposite side of a
channel, between it and Greenland: “Now is to be
told what lies opposite Greenland, out from the bay
already mentioned. Furdustrandir is the name of a
land. There are such hard frosts there that it is not
habitable as far as is known. South of it is Helluland,
which is called Skraeling’s land. From there it is not
far to Vinland the good, which some think goes out
from Africa. Between Vinland and Greenland is
Ginnungagap which flows from the sea called Mare
Oceanum that encompasses the whole earth.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> On a
map made by Sigurd Stephanius, an Icelander, in 1570,
Helluland, Markland, Skraeling’s land, and the promontory
of Vinland are represented as parts of the
country now called Greenland.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>No geographical information contained in the sagas
of Iceland and Greenland verifies the statement that
the Northmen discovered America and explored the
coast of a part of the present territory of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
States. What tradition relates respecting the Northmen
finding wine-berries in Vinland does not make it
indubitably evident that they were the fruit now called
grapes.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The wine-wood that was cut and carried on
board of Leif’s ship indicates that there was no large
timber in Vinland, and that the trees that were felled
were of a stunted growth as those that are now found
on the coast of Greenland. The statements respecting
the great number of eider ducks, the natives who were
frightened by the bellowing of a bull, the skin-boats
used by them, the want of food by the Northmen,
their eating the flesh of a stranded whale to escape
starvation, and the sarcastic language of the song sung
by Thorhall concerning Vinland being a land of wine,
clearly establish the fact that this country or region
was very near the Arctic circle. Further, all the early
maps of Greenland show Helluland, Markland, and
Vinland to be regions of that country.</p>

<p>The questionable interpretation of the characters
on the rock, lying in the water, on the east side of the
Taunton River, opposite Dighton, Massachusetts, by a
number of foreign antiquaries, is a notable exemplification
of the fictitious nature of the so-called evidence
that the Northmen discovered America and explored
a part of the eastern coast of the present territory of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The remarkable statement that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
round, stone-tower, at Newport, Rhode Island, mentioned
by Governor Benedict Arnold in his will, made
in 1677, as “my stone-built windmill,” was erected by
the Northmen, is also an instance of the infatuation of
the learned men who believed it to be a Norse monument.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The supposition that the Welsh adventurer, Madoc
Guyneth, planted a colony on the Atlantic coast of
North America, in the twelfth century, rests on some
traditionary information in a history of Wales, published
in 1584.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In this rare work it is related that the sons
of Owen Guyneth, King of North Wales, on the death
of their father, had many contentions respecting the
heirship to his estates and who should rule after him.
This strife mortified Madoc. In order to separate
himself from his quarrelling brothers he fitted out a
number of ships and sailed west, “leaving the coast of
Ireland so far north, that he came to an unknown land,
where he saw many strange things.” He then returned
home and gave an account of the attractive
and fertile countries “he had seen without inhabitants.”
He induced a number of men and women, who desired
to live peaceably, to emigrate to the western land.
The second voyage was safely made to the colony in
the “fair and large country.” He returned again to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Wales for more colonists. Ten ships filled with emigrants
shortly afterward set sail for the new settlement.
It is further related that many fictions were current
thereafter respecting Madoc’s discoveries in the unnamed
country.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Meredith ap Rhees, a Welsh bard,
who died in 1477, has rehearsed in a number of verses
a part of the unsatisfactory tradition concerning Madoc’s
voyage.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> As said by Baron von Humboldt:
“The deepest obscurity still shrouds every thing connected
with the voyage of the Gaelic chief, Madoc.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The story of a Frisland fisherman, in the history of
the discoveries of the Zeni brothers, published in 1558,
is thought by some writers to be a true narrative of
this man’s adventures on a part of the continent of
America, in the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is related that
Nicolò Zeno, a wealthy man, had a ship built, equipped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and manned at his own expense, and sailed in it from
Venice, “with the intention of visiting England and
Flanders.” But in a storm his vessel was cast upon an
island called Frisland.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> “The crew were saved together
with most of the ship’s cargo. This occurred
in the year 1380. The inhabitants of the island, having
collected in considerable numbers, attacked the chevalier
and his men, who, being exhausted by the hardships
they had endured, and not knowing in what part
of the world they had been thrown, were unable to
resist them, much less to defend themselves with the
spirit that the emergency demanded. They would
have been treated, without doubt, in a most barbarous
manner, had it not fortunately happened that a powerful
chieftain, with an armed force, was in their neighborhood,
who, learning that a large ship had been cast
upon the island, and hearing the noise and shouts of
the inhabitants as they rushed upon our poor mariners,
hastened forward, and putting the islanders to flight,
inquired of the Venetians, in Latin, of what nation they
were, and whence they had come. When informed
that they were from Italy, and natives of that country,
he was filled with joy and amazement.... He
was a great lord and possessed certain islands called
Porland, about a half-day’s sail from Frisland, the
richest and most populous of all the islands of those
parts. This chieftain’s name was Zichmni.”</p>

<p>Nicolò Zeno then entered the service of this distinguished
man. Some time afterward he wrote to his
brother Antonio, and related these incidents. The
latter visited Frisland, where he lived fourteen years.
On the death of Nicolò, which occurred four years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
after Antonio’s arrival, he was appointed to take command
of Zichmni’s fleet. From letters written by
Antonio to his brother Carlo, the remarkable particulars
of the following narrative are said to have been
compiled:</p>

<p>“Six and twenty years ago four fishing-boats put
out to sea from Frisland, and being overtaken by a
storm were drifted about for many days in a helpless
condition. When, at last, the tempest abated, they
descried an island called Estotiland,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> lying more than
a thousand miles westward from Frisland. One of
the boats was cast upon its coast, and the six men
in it were taken by the inhabitants and conducted to a
fair and populous city, where the king sent for many
interpreters, but none could be found who understood
the language of the fishermen except one man who
spoke Latin, and who likewise had been cast by accident
upon the same island. Ordered by the king, he
asked them who they were, and where they came from,
and when he reported their answer, the king desired
that they should remain in that country. Accordingly,
as they could not do otherwise, they obeyed his order,
and remained five years on the island, and learned the
language. One of them in particular visited different
parts of the island, and reports that it is a very rich
country, abounding in all good things. It is a little
smaller than Iceland but more fertile. In the middle
of it is a very high mountain, in which rise four rivers
which water the whole country.</p>

<p>“The inhabitants are a very intelligent people and
possess all the arts as we do; and it is believed that
in time past they have had intercourse with our people,
for he said that he saw Latin books in the king’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
library, which they at the present time do not understand.
They have their own language and letters.
They have all kinds of metals, especially gold. Their
foreign intercourse is with Greenland, where they
import furs, brimstone, and pitch. He says that toward
the south there is a great and populous country, very
rich in gold. They sow corn and make beer, which is
a kind of drink which northern people take as we do
wine. They have woods of vast extent. They construct
their buildings with walls, and there are many
towns and villages. They make small boats and sail
them, but they have not the loadstone, nor do they
know the north by the compass. For this reason these
fishermen were held in great esteem, insomuch that
the king sent them with twelve boats to the southward
to a country which they call Drogio; but in their
voyage they had such stormy weather that they were
in fear for themselves. Although they escaped a miserable
death they afterward met a more painful one,
for they were taken into the country and the greater
number of them were eaten by the savages, who are
cannibals and consider human flesh very savory meat.
But as this fisherman and his remaining companions
were able to show them the way to catch fish with
nets, their lives were spared. Every day he would go
fishing in the sea and in the fresh waters, and take a
great number of fish, which he gave to the chiefs, and
thereby ingratiated himself so much into their favor
that he was greatly liked and held in high esteem
by all.</p>

<p>“As this man’s fame spread among the different
tribes, there was a neighboring chief who was very
anxious to have him with him and to see how he practised
his wonderful art of catching fish. With this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
object in view he made war on the other chief with
whom the fisherman was, and being more powerful
and a better warrior, he, at last, overcame him, and so
the fisherman was sent to him with the rest of his
companions. During the space of thirteen years that
he dwelt in those parts, he says, he was sent in this
manner to more than five-and-twenty chiefs, for they
were continually fighting among themselves, this chief
with that one, and solely for the purpose of having the
fisherman to dwell with them, so that wandering up
and down the country without any fixed abode, he became
acquainted with almost all those regions. He
says that it is a very great country, and, as it were, a
new world. The people are very rude and uncultivated,
for they all go naked, and suffer bitterly from
the cold, nor have they the sense to clothe themselves
with skins of the animals which they take in hunting.
They have no kind of metal. They live by hunting,
and carry lances of wood, sharpened at the point.
They have bows, the strings of which are made of
beasts’ skins. They are very fierce, and have deadly
wars with one another, and eat the flesh of their captives.
They have chiefs and certain laws, but differing
in different tribes. The farther you go southwestward,
however, the more refinement you meet with, because
the climate is more temperate, but there they have
cities and temples dedicated to their idols, in which
they sacrifice men and afterward eat them. In those
parts they have some knowledge and use of gold and
silver.</p>

<p>“This fisherman after dwelling so many years in
those parts resolved to return home if possible to his
own country, but his companions, despairing of ever
seeing it again, gave him Godspeed, and remained
where they were. Accordingly he bade them farewell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and made his escape through the woods in the direction
of Drogio, where he was welcomed and kindly
received by the chief of the place, who knew him and
was a great enemy of the neighboring chief. Thus
passing from one chief to another, being the same with
whom he had been before, he, at last, reached, after
a long time and many hardships, Drogio, where he
remained three years. Here by good fortune he
learned from the natives that some boats had appeared
off the coast, and hopeful of being able to carry
out his intention, he went to the beach, and found to
his great delight that the men on board the boats had
come from Estotiland. He immediately begged them
to take him back with them, which they willingly consented
to do. He understood the language of the
country which none of them could speak, and they
employed him as an interpreter. Afterward he traded
in company with them to such good purpose that he
became very rich, and having fitted out a vessel of his
own he returned to Frisland.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>When Zichmni heard the story of the returned
fisherman, it is said that he prepared a fleet to go to
the countries described by him. The fisherman dying
about the time that the vessels were ready to sail,
some of the seamen who had come from Estotiland in
his ship were taken to pilot them. An island called
Icaria was discovered, but no exploration of it could
be made on account of the hostility of its inhabitants.
The fleet afterward proceeded to the coast of Greenland,
from which it sailed to Frisland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>The compiler of the history of the discoveries of
the Zeni brothers says: “This discovery [made by
the Frisland fisherman] Messere Antonio, in a letter to
his brother Messere Carlo, related, ... saying
that we have changed some old words and the antiquated
style, but have left the substance entire....
Of these northern places, I [the compiler] have
thought it good to draw a copy of the sailing chart,
which I find I have among our family heirlooms, and,
although it is rotten with age, I have succeeded with
it tolerably well; and to those who take pleasure in
such things, it will serve to throw light on the comprehension
of that which without it could not be understood
so easily.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it is difficult to disprove that the
names Frislanda, Engronelanda, and Estotilanda were
not early designations for Iceland, Greenland, and Scotland,
the supposition that the unnamed Frisland fisherman
passed thirteen years of his life on the continent
of America solely rests upon the particulars of the
story of his famous adventures as a maker of fishing-nets.</p>

</div>

<p>In the opulent and insular city of Venice, there
arrived, a few years before the close of the thirteenth
century, three strangely clad sun-embrowned men. If
any notice had been taken of them when they disembarked
from the Mediterranean galley in which they
had come from Negropont, this attention had, it is
likely, been bestowed upon their odd garb and imperfect
pronunciation of the Italian words which they used
while obtaining a boatman to convey them to that part
of the city known as the confine of S. Giovanni
Crisostomo.</p>

<p>The unique story respecting the return of these
famous travellers to Venice will always be deemed
the prologue that introduces the notable acts of the
explorers of the Atlantic coast territory of America
in the fifteenth century. It is therefore properly entitled
to a conspicuous place on the first pages of the
history of the discovery of America. Five centuries
ago it charmed the Venetians with its vivid colorings,
and gave to the Orient an entrancing vision that made
the name of Cathay for a time a synonym for an earthly
paradise. It pictured to them a far-off El Dorado,
abounding with gold, gems, and spicery, a country
naturally delightful and artificially magnificent. America
lay in some of the navigable ways which were
sought by acquisitive Europeans to go to it, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the return of Nicolò, Maffeo, and Marco Polo, in 1295,
to Venice, after an absence of twenty-four years, is
inseparably linked to the great chain of events connecting
it with the discovery of the new continent of
the western hemisphere.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Ramusio, the distinguished
Italian collector of information relating to voyages and
travels, has preserved the account of the strange
revelations made by the three travellers on their
return from Cathay.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>“When they arrived here the same fate befell them
which happened to Ulysses, who, when he returned
after his twenty years’ wanderings to his native Ithaca,
was recognized by none of his people. In like manner
these three gentlemen, who had been absent so many
years from their native city, were not identified by any
of their kinsfolk, who believed that they had been dead
for many years, as had been reported. They were
quite changed in appearance by the prolongation and
hardships of their journeys and by the trouble and
anxieties they had experienced; and they had a certain
indescribable smack of the Tartar both in demeanor
and accent, having indeed almost forgotten their Venetian
tongue. Their clothes, too, were coarse and
shabby, and of a Tartar cut. They proceeded on their
arrival to their house, in this city, in the confine of S.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Giovanni Crisostomo, where you may see it to this
day. The house, which in those days was a lofty and
handsome palace, is now known by the name of the
Court of the Millions, for a reason which I will tell you
presently.</p>

<p>“When they reached the palace, they found it occupied
by some of their relatives, and they had the
utmost difficulty in making the latter understand who
they were. For these good people seeing them to be
in appearance so unlike what they were formerly, and
in dress so shabby, flatly refused to believe that they
were those very gentlemen of the Polo family whom
they thought had been dead many years. So these
three gentlemen,—this is a story I have often heard
when I was a boy from the illustrious Messere Gasparo
Malpiero, a gentleman of very great age and a senator
of eminent virtue and integrity, whose house was
on the canal of Santa Marianna, at the corner, over the
mouth of the brook of S. Giovanni Crisostomo, and
just midway among the buildings of the aforesaid Court
of the Millions, and he said he had heard the story from
his own father and grandfather, and from other old
men among the neighbors,—the three gentlemen, I say,
devised a scheme by which they should obtain at once
from their kinsfolk the recognition they desired, and
secure the honorable notice of the whole city; and this
was it:</p>

<p>“They invited a number of their kindred to an
entertainment, which they purposely prepared with
great state and splendor in their house. When the
hour arrived for sitting down to table all three came
from their chambers clothed in crimson satin, fashioned
in long robes reaching to the ground, such as people in
those days wore within doors. And when water for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the hands had been served, and the guests were seated,
they took off these robes and put on others of crimson
damask, while the first suits were by their orders cut
and divided among the servants. Then after partaking
of some of the dishes they went out again and came
back in robes of crimson velvet, and when they had
again taken their seats, the second suits were divided
as the first. When dinner was over they did the like
with the robes of velvet, after they had put on dresses
of the ordinary fashion worn by their guests. These
proceedings caused much wonder and amazement
among their relatives. But when the cloth had been
drawn, and all the servants had been ordered to retire
from the dining-hall, Messere Marco, the youngest of
the three, rose from the table, and going into another
chamber brought forth the three shabby dresses of
coarse stuff which they had worn when they first arrived.
Straightway they took sharp knives and began
to rip open some of the seams and welts, and to take
out of them many gems of the greatest value, such as
rubies, sapphires, carbuncles, diamonds, and emeralds,
all of which had been stitched up in these dresses in
a manner so artful that nobody could have suspected
the fact. For when they took leave of the Grand Khan
they changed all the wealth which he had bestowed
upon them for these rubies, emeralds, and other gems,
being well aware of the impossibility of carrying with
them so great an amount of gold on a journey so long
and so difficult.</p>

<p>“Now the exhibition of this large number of gems
and precious stones, all scattered over the table, threw
the guests into fresh amazement, insomuch that they
seemed quite bewildered and speechless. They now
saw that in spite of all their former doubts these were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
really the honored and worthy gentlemen of the Polo
family as they had claimed to be, and they therefore
paid them the greatest honor and reverence. And
when the story became current in Venice, straightway
the whole city, gentle and simple, flocked to the house
to embrace them, and to make much of them, with
every conceivable demonstration of affection and respect.</p>

<p>“On Messere Maffeo, who was the eldest, the
Venetians conferred the honors of an office which was
of great dignity in those days; while the young men
came daily to visit and converse with the ever-polite
and gracious Messere Marco, and to ask him questions
about Cathay<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and the Grand Khan, all of which he
answered with such kindly courtesy that every man felt
himself in a manner his debtor. And as it happened
that in the story, which he was constantly called on to
repeat, of the magnificence of the Grand Khan, he
would speak of his revenues as amounting to ten or
fifteen millions of gold; and in like manner, when
recounting other instances of great wealth in those
parts, he would always make use of the term millions,
so they gave him the nickname of Messere Marco
Millioni, an appellation which I have seen in the public
records of this republic where mention is made of him.
The court of his house, in the confine of S. Giovanni
Crisostomo, has always from that time been known as
the Corte del Millioni.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>These conversational descriptions respecting the
remote dominions of the Grand Khan, with which
Marco Polo often interested the imaginative Venetians,
were to have a much wider field of influence in
another form,—one which was a most potent element
among the leading agencies which opened to the people
of Western Europe great pathways of discovery
and of commerce around the earth. In order to perceive
how these descriptions of Cathay led to the exploration
of the Atlantic Ocean and the discovery of the
continent of America, the fortunes of Marco Polo must
be followed farther. It appears that shortly after his
return to Venice he was placed in command of a fleet,
which subsequently was captured by the Genoese in a
naval engagement. While confined in Genoa as a
prisoner of war, his remarkable adventures as an
explorer of remote eastern countries became known,
and he was often visited and questioned by inquisitive
people. Wearied by the frequent repetition of the story
of his wanderings in Cathay, he at last applied himself
to writing an account of his extensive journeys by the
aid of such notes and memoranda as he had taken while
in the East. Assisted by a Genoese gentleman, he
completed his curious and instructive narrative, which
was soon copied, translated into different languages,
and distributed among the people of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>As justly claimed by Yule, Marco Polo was the
first traveller “to trace a route across the longitude
of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after kingdom
which he had seen with his own eyes; the deserts
of Persia, the flowering plateaux and wild gorges
of Badakhshan, the jade-bearing rivers of Khotan, the
Mongolian steppes, ... the new and brilliant
court that had been established at Cambaluc; the first
traveller to reveal China in all its wealth and vastness,
its mighty rivers, its huge cities, its rich manufactures,
its swarming population, the inconceivably vast fleets
that quickened its seas and its inland waters; to tell us
of the nations on its borders with all their eccentricities
of manners and worship; of Tibet with its sordid
devotees; of Burma, with its golden pagodas and their
tinkling crowns; of Laos, of Siam, of Cochin China,
of Japan, the Eastern Thule, with its rosy pearls and
golden-roofed palaces; the first to speak of that museum
of beauty and wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked,
the Indian archipelago, source of aromatics
then so highly prized and whose origin was so dark;
of Java, the pearl of islands; of Sumatra with its many
kings, its strange costly products, and its cannibal
races; of the naked savages of Nicobar and Andaman;

account of the secluded Christian empire of
Abyssinia and the semi-Christian island of Socotra; to
speak, though indeed dimly, of Zanzibar with its negroes
and its ivory, and of the vast and distant Madagascar,
bordering on the dark ocean of the South, with its ruc
and other monstrocities; and, in a remotely opposite
region, of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, of dog-sledges,
white bears, and reindeer-riding Tunguses.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Never before had the people of Europe heard of
such extraordinary wealth and unlimited resources as
existed in the far-off countries visited by Marco Polo.
His novel descriptions of stately, gold-covered palaces,
of the royal magnificence of the entertainments of the
Grand Khan, of the intoxicating fragrance of an endless
profusion of rare flowers, of luscious fruits and sweet
spicery, of heavily laden argosies of valuable merchandise
floating on noble rivers, and of vast collections of
gold, silver, and precious stones, were read with the
most exaggerated conceptions of their reality. These
enchanting details respecting Cathay and the adjacent
countries were fully confirmed in the fourteenth century
by Sir John Mandeville, who, in 1322, departed from
England, and after an absence of thirty-four years in
different countries returned to write, in Latin, in French,
and in English, a narrative of his extended travels.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Dazzled by the splendor of the Orient the people
of Western Europe were eager to enter into commercial
intercourse with the inhabitants of Cathay. But there
were innumerable barriers, both natural and political,
obstructing all the overland ways to the East. Chief
among the obstacles classed as political was the selfish
exclusiveness of the different governments possessing
the intervening territory. Had there been no national
opposition to the establishment of a protected system
of overland commerce between Western Europe and
Eastern Asia, the distance was too great to be travelled
over by slowly moving caravans.</p>

<p>As early as the year 1343 the aggressive enterprise
of the Venetians had obtained from the sultan of
Egypt the exclusive privilege of sending ships to trade
in the ports of that country and of Syria. The merchants
of Venice thereupon established commercial
agencies at Alexandria and Damascus. Their factors
penetrated Central and Southern Asia, and became
active participants in the remunerative traffic of those
regions. The prized productions of the islands in the
Indian Ocean, such as pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and
other spices, were transported by them to Venice and
distributed through Europe. Although the ocean along
the western and southern coast of Africa to the East
was believed to be navigable, no attempt was made
in the fourteenth century to sail by it to the Moluccas
or Spice Islands. Concerning the early navigation of
the sea-path along the coast of Africa, from the Pillars
of Hercules to the Arabian Sea, Herodotus says that
when Necho, king of Egypt, “had ceased digging the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
canal leading from the Nile to the Arabian Gulf, he
sent certain Phœnicians in ships, with orders to sail
between the Pillars of Hercules into the Northern
Sea [the Mediterranean], and so to return to Egypt.
These Phœnicians, taking their course from the Red
Sea, entered the Southern Ocean. On the approach
of autumn they landed in Libya [Africa], and planted
some corn in the place where they happened to find
themselves. When this was ripe, and they had cut it
down, they again departed. Having thus consumed
two years, they in the third doubled the Pillars of
Hercules, and returned to Egypt. Their account may
obtain attention from others, but to me it seems incredible,
for they affirmed, that having sailed around
Libya, they had the sun on their right hand. Thus
was Libya for the first time known.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Pliny, the celebrated encyclopedist of ancient times,
says that “while the power of Carthage was at its
height, Hanno published an account of a voyage which
he made from Gades [Cadiz, Spain], to the extremity
of Arabia.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> ... Besides, we learn from Cornelius
Nepos, that one Eudoxus, a contemporary of his, when
he was fleeing from King Lathyrus, set out from the
Arabian Gulf, and was carried as far as Gades.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And
long before him, Cælius Antipater informs us that he
had seen a person who had sailed from Spain to
Æthiopia for the purpose of trade. The same Cornelius
Nepos, when speaking of the northern circumnavigation,
tells us that Q. Metellus Celer, the colleague
of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
proconsul in Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> had a present made to him by the
king of the Suevi,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of certain Indians, who, sailing
from India for the purpose of commerce, had been
driven by tempests to Germany.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>These statements were quoted in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries to support the growing belief that
India could be reached in a short time by sailing round
the coast of Africa. But the want of nautical instruments
restrained seamen from undertaking a voyage
which carried them beyond the sight of familiar coasts
and beneath new constellations. It was extremely
perilous for European navigators to attempt to sail to
India before they had acquired a knowledge of the use
of the mariner’s compass and of the astrolabe. The
polarity of the magnet was known among oriental
nations several centuries before the Christian era. The
use of the magnetic needle for the guidance of vessels,
however, did not become popular in Europe until as
late as the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The slowness with
which its use grew into favor with European seamen is
ascribable to the prevailing superstition which hung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
like a darkening cloud over the minds of the people.
The strange conservatism of the age is well described
in a letter written, as it seems, in the year 1258, by
Brunetto Latini, a learned Italian, Dante’s tutor, to
Guido Cavalcanti of Florence. Speaking of his visit
to Roger Bacon, the English philosopher and monk, at
Oxford, England, he says:</p>

<p>“The Parliament being summoned to assemble at
Oxford, I did not fail to see Friar Bacon as soon as I
arrived, and [among other things] he showed me a
black ugly stone, called a magnet, which has the surprising
property of drawing iron to it; and upon which,
if a needle be rubbed, and afterwards fastened to a
straw, so that it shall swim upon water, the needle will
instantly turn toward the pole-star; therefore, be the
night ever so dark, so that neither moon nor star be
visible, yet shall the mariner be able, by the help of the
needle, to steer his vessel aright.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>“This discovery, which appears useful in so great
a degree to all who travel by sea, must remain concealed
until other times, because no master-mariner
dares to use it lest he should fall under a supposition
of his being a magician; nor would even the sailors
venture themselves out to sea under his command if
he took with him an instrument which carries so great
an appearance of being constructed under the influence
of some infernal spirit. A time may come when these
prejudices, which are of such great hindrance to researches
into the secrets of nature, will probably be no
more; and then it will be that mankind shall reap the
benefit of the labors of such learned men as Friar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Bacon, and do justice to that industry and intelligence
for which he and they now meet with no other return
than obloquy and reproach.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>About the beginning of the fourteenth century,
Flavia Gioja of Amalfi, in Naples, devised what were
then known as the eight points of the superficies—the
four cardinal and the four intermediate points of the
compass-card.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> From this time forward the use of the
magnet gradually found favor with European seamen.</p>

<p>The most enthusiastic projector of voyages of discovery
undertaken to ascertain the character of the
land and water divisions of the earth, in the early part
of the fifteenth century, was Prince Henry, the son of
King John I. of Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> When twenty-one years of
age, he witnessed, in 1415, the taking of Ceuta, on
the northern coast of Africa, opposite the southern extremity
of Portugal. While at this opulent city, he
learned from its merchants and traders that the continent
extended far southward and was inhabited by
many strange people. Fixing his residence on the
promontory of Sagres, at the southwestern extremity
of Portugal, he began to send the most experienced seamen
in the service of Portugal to explore the western
coast of Africa. For a time Cape de Não, in north latitude,
28° 45´ was considered the limit of safe navigation.
It was a common saying among Portuguese seamen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
that “He who should pass Cabo de Não, either will
return or not.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Beyond it was Cape Bojador, in 26°
12´ north latitude. This rocky headland, for a time, was
also deemed perilous and impassable. “Beyond this
cape” it was said, “there is no people whatever;
the ground is as barren as that of Libya,—no water, no
trees, no grass in it; the sea is so shallow that at a
league from the land it is only a fathom deep; the currents
are so strong that a ship passing the cape cannot
return.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The attempts made by Prince Henry’s mariners
to double the two capes are thus commented upon
by Antonio Galvano, the Portuguese historian,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in his
treatise respecting the routes by which spices came
from India to the year 1550: “In those days none of
the Portuguese had yet passed Cabo de Não in 29 degrees
of latitude.” But after it was doubled, “when
they came to another cape named Bojador, there was
not one of them that dared to risk his life beyond it.
The prince was exceedingly displeased with their want
of confidence and unmanly timidity.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Of the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of seamen that had made unsuccessful attempts to pass
the cape was Gil Eannes. Disappointed as Prince
Henry was by these failures to accomplish that which
he had ordered them to do, he nevertheless gave his
timorous navigators all the encouragement he could to
induce them to make other and more persistent efforts
to double the formidable headland. In 1434, he again
sent Gil Eannes to explore the coast beyond Cape
Bojador. Before the latter departed the prince endeavored
to dispel the terrifying fancies that might
deter him from attempting to prosecute the undertaking
for which he was commissioned. “You cannot
incur such peril” said the prince, “that the promised
reward shall not be commensurate thereto. It is very
strange to me that you should be governed by a fear
of something of which you are ignorant, for if the
things reported had any authentication, I should not
find fault with you for believing them. The stories of the
four seamen driven out of their course to Flanders or
to the ports to which they were sailing are not to be
credited, for they had not and could not have used the
needle and the chart. But do you go notwithstanding,
and make your voyage without being influenced by
their opinions, and, by the grace of God, you will not
fail to secure, by your enterprise, both honor and compensation.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Gil Eannes followed the advice of his
sanguine patron, and succeeded the same year in doubling
Cape Bojador and in exploring a part of the coast
beyond it.</p>

<p>South of Cape Bojador it was believed that a zone
of scorching heat would be entered by vessels sailing
toward the equator. Pliny adverts to it in these
words: “The middle of the earth, over which is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
path of the sun, is parched and set on fire by the luminary,
and is consumed by being so near the heat.
There are only two of the zones which are temperate—those
which lie between the torrid and the frigid
zones—and these are separated from each other, in consequence
of the scorching heat of the heavenly bodies.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Conceiving this statement to be as fallacious as many
other declarations of the early geographers had been,
Prince Henry, in 1454, sent Luigi da Cadamosto, a
Venetian navigator, to explore the coast beyond Cape
Bojador so long invested with so many imaginary terrors.
In 1462 Pedro de Cintra sailed three hundred
miles beyond Sierre Leone.</p>

<p>As it was necessary for seamen to know the latitude
and longitude of the places to which they desired to
sail, another nautical instrument besides the mariner’s
compass was needed by them.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The adaptation of an
instrument called the astrolabe, by which the latitudes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of places could be determined, apparently originated
with King John II. of Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It is said that “when Prince Henry began the discovery
of Guinea that all mariners were accustomed to
sail along the coasts, and that they always steered their
courses by observing the physical features of the land,
which are still used as guides.”</p>

<p>“This method of navigating permitted them to make
voyages from place to place; but when they wished
to sail in the open sea, losing sight of the coast and
standing out on the wide ocean, they perceived the
numerous errors they had made in calculating and
judging the day’s run, for they had been accustomed
to allow so much way to the ship in the twenty-four
hours on account of the currents and the other mysteries
of the sea, the facts of which are clearly demonstrated
by navigating by altitude. But as necessity is
the teacher of all arts, in the time of King John II.,
the matter of navigation was assigned by him to Master
Roderic, and Master Joseph, a Jew, (who were his
physicians,) and to one Martin of Bohemia, a native of
those parts, who boasted of being a pupil of John of
Monteregius, a famous astronomer among the professors
of that science,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and these devised the way of navigating
by the sun’s altitude, and they made tables of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
his declination such as are now used by navigators,
now more complete than they were at the beginning
when the great wooden astrolabes were first used.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>This novel and serviceable nautical instrument, first
made of wood and of a triangular shape, was soon in
general use on Portuguese vessels. The astrolabe was
improved from time to time. At the beginning of the
seventeenth century, when the French seaman, Samuel
de Champlain, was exploring the St. Lawrence River
and its tributaries, it was a disk of brass, having one of
its faces marked with degrees and minutes. A brass
rule, called a label, with sight-holes, turning upon a
pivot at the centre of the instrument, moved over the
marked circumference of the disk. At the zenith part
of the instrument there was a small ring by which it
could be suspended from the thumb of the person taking
an observation. When used the astrolabe was turned
to the sun, so that his rays could freely pass through
the two sight-holes of the label. In this position the
altitude of the sun was indicated on the divided limb of
the instrument. Opposite the zenith point was a small
eyelet from which a weight could be suspended to keep
the instrument from shaking when used.</p>

</div>

<p>In the fifteenth century the day’s run of a ship was
commonly reckoned by the pilot. In an old nautical
work it is said: “In order to know the speed of the
ship over the length of the course the pilot must set
down in his journal the progress the vessel has made
according to hours; and to do this he must know that
the greatest distance that a ship advances in an hour is
four miles, and with feebler breezes, three or only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
two.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Time was measured by sand-glasses, or <i>ampolletas</i>,
as they were called by the Spaniards. Forty-eight
changes of these half-hour glasses equalled the
space of a day.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In 1487 the persistent enterprise of the Portuguese
in exploring a commercial route to India along the
west and south coasts of Africa was notably signalized
by the success attending the expedition commanded by
the adventurous seaman, Bartolomeu Dias. The indomitable
zeal of this Portuguese mariner enabled him
to reach the southern extremity of Africa, where he
found a bold promontory to which he gave the name
of Cabo Tormentoso, (the Stormy Cape,) commemorative
of the adverse winds and bad weather encountered
there. King John II., personally appreciating the good
fortune attending the explorations of the navigators of
Portugal in this direction during the previous seventy
years, in which time more than six thousand miles of
coast-line had been inspected by them, called the promontory
discovered by Dias, Cabo de Boa Esperança
(the Cape of Good Hope).<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The success attending the voyages of the Portuguese
along the coast of Africa suggested to Cristoforo
Colombo<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> (or Christopher Columbus, as he is more
commonly called by those speaking English), the possibility
of sailing by a shorter way to India in another
direction. Ferdinand Columbus, in his history of the
life and achievements of his father,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> makes no attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
conceal this fact from publicity. With an apparent
intention to give all the information which might be
desired concerning the great discoverer’s first thoughts
respecting the practicability of reaching Asia by sailing
in a westerly direction, he frankly tells what originated
them in the mind of the admiral. “As one thing leads
to another, and one thought to another, in this way,
while the admiral was in Portugal, he began to infer
that as the Portuguese sailed so far southward, it was
also feasible to steer westward, and that land might
likely be found in this direction. In order to be more
assured and satisfied in this matter, he began to review
the cosmographies which he had read, and to note what
astronomical reasons would support this theory.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
he might be more enlightened concerning his assumption,
he paid attention to what was said by people
respecting it, especially by seamen. His diligent investigations
soon led him to conclude that there were many
lands west of the Canaries and the Cape Verd Islands,
and that it was practicable to sail to and discover
them.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The remarkable aptitude displayed by Columbus
in forming his conclusions that the Atlantic Ocean was
navigable, and that ships might pass across its unexplored
expanse to Cathay, was the natural expression
of his peculiar passion for geographical knowledge. In
a letter written to their Spanish majesties, King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella, in 1501, he says: “I went
to sea when quite young, and have continued my sea-faring
until now; and this profession makes those who
follow it eager to discover the secrets of this globe. It
is now forty years that I have been sailing to all those
places which are at present visited, and I have dealt
and talked with learned people, ecclesiastics as well as
laymen, Latins, Greeks, Indians, Moors, and many
other people of different nations, and our Lord has
favored this inclination, and I have received from him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
the spirit of understanding. He has made me very
skillful in navigation, and to know much in astronomy,
in geometry, and mathematics. God has given me the
knowledge and the ability to portray the globe, and
also to delineate cities, rivers, islands, and ports in their
proper situation. During my life I have examined and
endeavored to see all books of cosmography, history,
and philosophy, and of the other sciences, so that our
Lord has sensibly opened my mind in order that I may
sail from here to the Indies, and has made me extremely
anxious to do it.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Columbus’s irrepressible desire to possess all the
information he could acquire respecting the navigable
water-ways of the Atlantic also led him to sail over the
sea-path to Iceland and to the south coast of Africa, at
the equator. In his geographical work, written “to
show that all the five zones are habitable,” he says:
“‘In February, 1467, I sailed myself a hundred leagues
beyond Thule, the northern part of which is seventy
degrees distant from the equator, and not sixty-three
degrees as some will have it to be; nor does it lie upon
the line where Ptolemy’s West begins, but much more
to the westward, and to this island, which is as large as
England, the English trade, especially those from Bristol.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
At the time I was there the sea was not frozen,
but the tides were so great that in some places it
swelled twenty-six fathoms and fell as much.’ The
truth is, that the Thule of which Ptolemy speaks lies
where he says, and this is called by the moderns Frizeland.”
Again he says: “I have followed sea-faring for
twenty-three years without being on shore any space
of time worth mentioning, and I have seen all the East
and all the West, and have been to the North where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
England is situated, and even to Guinea.” He also
says that he went to sea when fourteen years old, and
ever after that led a sea-faring life.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Among the motives influencing him to think that
he could sail to Cathay by the way of the Atlantic
Ocean were the statements of geographical writers.
By them it was said “that a great part of the globe
had already been travelled over, and there only remained
to be discovered and made known the space
lying between the eastern limits of India, known to
Ptolemy and Marinus, and the West, where are the
islands Azores<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and those of Cape Verd,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the most
western lands yet discovered.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> ... He considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
that this space, lying between the eastern limits
[of India] known to Marinus and the islands of the
Cape Verd group, could not be more than a third part
of the great circumference of the globe, since Marinus
had gone toward the East fifteen hours of the twenty-four
into which the circumference of the earth is
divided, and therefore to go [still farther eastwardly]
to reach the Cape Verd Islands there were nine hours,
[of the circumference to be passed over], as it is said
that Marinus began his investigations in the West....
He conceived that since Marinus had given
in his cosmography an account of fifteen hours or
parts of the globe eastwardly, and had not reached the
limits of the East, it followed that its bounds must be
much beyond, and consequently the farther the land of
the East extended eastwardly, the nearer this land was
to the Cape Verd Islands in the West, and that if the
space were chiefly water it might easily be sailed in a
few days, and if it were mainly land it would sooner
be discovered by sailing westward, because it would be
nearer to the Cape Verd Islands.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> ... The
fifth reason, which induced him to believe that the distance
this way was short, was the opinion of Alfragranus
and his followers, who make the circumference of
the globe much less than all other writers and cosmographers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
allowing fifty-six miles and two-thirds to a
degree.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Whence he inferred that as the entire circumference
of the globe was of such an extent, the
third part was small, which Marinus left unknown....
And Seneca, in his first book of nature, who
considers the knowledge of this world as nothing when
compared with that which is acquired in the next life,
says a ship may sail in a few days with a fair wind from
the coast of Spain to that of India. And if it be true,
as some believe, that Seneca wrote tragedies, we may
infer that he speaks of the same thing in the chorus of
his Medea:</p>

really fulfilled in the person of the admiral....
Marco Polo, the Venetian, and John Mandeville,
in their travels say that they went much farther
eastward than Ptolemy and Marinus mention, who,
although they do not speak of the Eastern Sea, yet by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the account they give of the East it may be assumed
that India is not far distant from Africa and Spain.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Ferdinand Columbus further says that his father
expected to find, “before he came to India, a very
convenient island or continent, from which he might
pursue with more advantage his main design. This
hope was grounded upon the statements of many wise
men and philosophers, who believed that the greatest
part of this terraqueous globe was land, or that there
was more land than water, which, if true, he assumed
that between the coast of Spain and the limits of India
then known, there were many islands and a considerable
extent of main-land.... A pilot of the king
of Portugal, named Martin Vicente, told him that, being
at one time four hundred and fifty leagues westward of
Cape St. Vincent, he found and picked up in the sea a
piece of wood ingeniously carved, but not with iron,
which led him to believe, as the wind had been blowing
from the west for several days, that the piece of wood
had drifted from some island lying toward the west.
Then one Pedro Correa, who had married the sister of
the admiral’s wife, told him that at the island of Porto
Santo<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> he had seen another piece of wood, brought by
the same winds, as nicely carved as the piece already
mentioned, and that canes had been found there so
thick that each joint would hold more than four quarts
of wine, which reports he said he communicated to the
king of Portugal while talking to him about these
matters. The pieces of cane were shown to him.
There being no place in our parts where such cane
grew, he inferred it to be true that the wind had
brought the cane from some neighboring islands or else
from India. For Ptolemy, in the first book of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
geography, in the seventeenth chapter, says there is
such cane in the eastern parts of India. And some of
the people living on the islands, particularly on the
Azores, told him that when the west wind blew for a
long time the sea drifted some pieces of pine-wood
upon those islands, particularly on the islands Gratiosa
and Fayal, there being no pine-wood in all those parts,
and that the sea cast upon the island of Flores, another
of the Azores, the bodies of two dead men, who were
very broad-faced and different in appearance from Christians.
At Cape Verd and thereabouts they said that
they once saw some covered canoes or boats which the
people believed were driven there by stress of weather
while the persons in them were going from one island
to another. Nor were these the only grounds he then
had which seemed reasonable, for there were those
who told him that they had seen some islands in the
western ocean.... These persons he did not
believe, because he discovered from their own words
and statements that they had not sailed one hundred
leagues to the westward, and that they had been deceived
by some rocks, thinking them to be islands; or
else, perhaps, they were some of those floating islands
which are drifted about by the waves, and which the
sailors call <i>aguados</i>....</p>

<p>“He says, moreover, that in the year 1484, a man
came to Portugal from the island of Madera<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> to beg a
caraval of the king to discover a country which he affirmed
he saw every year, and always after the same
manner, he agreeing with others who said they had
seen the island from the Azores. On this account the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Portuguese placed some islands thereabouts on the
charts and maps made at that time; and also because
Aristotle, in his book of wonderful things, affirms that
it was reported that some Carthaginian merchants had
sailed over the Atlantic Ocean to a most fruitful island....
This island the Portuguese inserted in their
maps, calling it Antilla, and though they did not give
it the same situation designated by Aristotle, yet none
placed it more than two hundred leagues due west from
the Canaries and the Azores. Some believe it to be
the island of the Seven Cities peopled by the Portuguese
at the time that Spain was conquered by the
Moors, in 714, at which time, they say, seven bishops
with their people embarked and sailed to this island,
where each of them built a city; and in order that
none of their people might think of returning to Spain,
they burnt the ships, tackle, and all things necessary
for sailing.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> ... It was also said that in the
time of Prince Henry of Portugal, a Portuguese ship
was driven by stress of weather to this island of Antilla,
where the men went on shore, and were conducted by
the islanders to their church to learn whether or not
they were Christians and acquainted with the Roman
ceremonies. After perceiving that they were, the people
of the island importuned them to remain till their king
came, who was then absent, and who would be delighted
to see them and would give them many presents....
But the master and the seamen were
afraid of being detained, suspecting these people did
not wish to be discovered and might for this reason
burn their ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“On this account they returned to Portugal, hoping
to be rewarded by the prince for what they had done.
He reproved them severely and bid them return at
once to the island, but the master through fear ran
away from Portugal with the ship and men. It is reported
that while the seamen were at church on the
island the ship-boys gathered sand for the cook-room,
the third part of which they found to be pure gold....
Seneca, in his fourth book, tells us that
Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> speaks of an island called Atlantica,
which in the time of the Peloponnesian war was entirely,
or the greater part of it, submerged; whereof
Plato also makes mention in his Timæus.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>While Columbus resided at Lisbon obtaining information
from geographers and seamen respecting the
feasibility of sailing westward to Cathay, he entered
into correspondence with Paolo Toscanelli, a Florentine
physician and astronomer.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The latter sent him a copy
of a letter which he had written in Latin to Ferdinand
Martinez, a prebendary of Lisbon. The communication
addressed to Columbus, is dated Florence, June
25, 1474. As translated the letter is as follows:</p>

<p>“To Christopher Colon, Paul, the physician, wishes
health.</p>

<p>“I apprehend your noble and earnest desire to sail
to those parts where spices grow, and therefore, in
answer to your letter, I send another, which some time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
ago I wrote to a friend of mine, in the service of the
king of Portugal, before the wars of Castile, in answer
to one he wrote me by his highness’s command, upon
the same subject. I also send you a sea-chart similar
to the one I sent him, which may satisfy your inquiries.
The copy of that letter is the following:</p>

<p>“To Ferdinand Martinez, canon of Lisbon, Paul,
the physician, wishes health.</p>

<p>“I am gratified to hear of your intimacy with the
most serene and magnificent king. Although I have
often spoken of the short distance by water from here
to the Indies where spices grow, which way, in my
opinion, is shorter than that taken along the coast of
Guinea, yet you inform me that his highness would have
me explain and demonstrate it in order that it may be
comprehended and tested. Although I could better
elucidate the configuration of the earth with a globe in
my hand, nevertheless, I will make the matter more easy
and intelligible by exhibiting the route on such a chart
as is used in navigation. I therefore send one to his
majesty, made and drawn with my own hand, on which
are delineated the extreme limits of the West, from Iceland,
in the north, to the farthest part of Guinea, in the
south, with all the intermediate islands. Opposite, in
the West, the beginning of the Indies is delineated,
with the islands and places to which you may go,
representing how far you may steer from the north pole
toward the equator, and for how long a time, that is, how
many leagues you may sail before you come to those
places where are to be found all kinds of spices and
precious stones. Do not think it strange if I call the
country where spices grow West, since they are generally
known to be produced in the East, because those who
shall sail westward will always find those places in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
west, and they who travel by land eastward, will always
find those places in the east. The straight lines which
are drawn lengthwise on the chart show the distance
from west to east, and those which cross the former
show the distance from north to south. I have also
marked down on the chart several places in the Indies
where ships might put in during a storm or contrary
winds, or any other unlooked-for accident. Moreover,
to give you ample information concerning all the places
of which you desire to know something, you must
understand that only traders live or reside on these
islands, and that you will find there as large a number
of ships and sea-faring people engaged in merchandizing
as in any other part of the world, particularly in the
famous port of the city called Zacton, where, every
year, a hundred large ships carrying pepper, are loaded
and unloaded, besides many other vessels freighted
with different kinds of spices.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> This country is an exceedingly
populous one, and there are many provinces,
kingdoms, and innumerable cities in it under the rule
of a sovereign called the Grand Khan, signifying king
of kings, who generally resides in the province of
Cathay. His predecessors greatly desired to have the
commerce and the friendship of Christians, and two
hundred years ago they sent embassadors to the pope,
to ask him to send them many learned men and doctors
to teach them our religion, but on account of some
obstacles the embassadors met with, they returned
without coming to Rome. Besides, there came an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
embassador to Pope Eugene IV., who informed him of
the great affection which their princes and people bore
toward the Christians. I talked with him a long time
concerning the magnificence of the royal palaces, the
greatness of the country, the length and breadth of the
rivers. He told me many wonderful things respecting
a great number of towns and cities built on the banks
of the rivers, and that there were two hundred cities on
a single river, with marble bridges over it of great
length and breadth, and sustained by many pillars.
This country deserves to be made known as well as any
other, and there may not only be great profits realized
and many things of value obtained, but also gold, silver,
all kinds of precious stones, and spices in abundance,
which are not brought into our parts. And it is certain
that many wise men, philosophers, astronomers, and
other persons skilled in the arts, and very ingenious
men govern this vast country and command its armies.
On the chart, from Lisbon directly westward to the
great and famous city of Quisay, are twenty-six spaces,
each measuring two hundred and fifty miles. The city
is one hundred miles, or thirty-five leagues in circuit,
and within its limits are ten marble bridges. The name
Quisay signifies city of heaven.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Wonderful things
are reported of the ingenuity of its inhabitants, its buildings
and revenues. The space previously mentioned
is almost a third part of the circumference of the globe.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
The city is in the province of Mango, bordering on that
of Cathay, where the king usually resides. From the
island Antilla (which you call the Seven Cities, and of
which you have some knowledge), to the great island
of Cipango,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> are ten spaces, which include two thousand
five hundred miles, or two hundred and twenty-five
leagues.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The island abounds with gold, pearls, and
precious stones; and you should know that they cover
their temples and palaces with plates of pure gold. All
these things are hidden and concealed, because the
way to them is unknown, and yet it may be sailed with
safety.</p>

<p>“Much more might be said, but having told you
that which is most important, and as you are learned
and have good judgment, I am satisfied that you will
understand what I have written without my adding
any thing further to these statements. This may satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
your curiosity, it being as much as my time and
business permit me now to write. However, I remain
ever ready to satisfy and serve his highness to the
utmost in all the commands that he shall lay upon
me.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>“The admiral, now believing that his opinion was
excellently well grounded,” says Ferdinand Columbus,
“resolved to be governed by it, and to sail across
the western ocean in quest of those countries. But
being aware that such an undertaking was only becoming
a monarch to espouse and to accomplish, he determined
to propose it to the king of Portugal, because
he was the latter’s subject. And though King John,
then reigning, gave ear to the admiral’s proposals, yet
he hesitated to accept them on account of the great
burden and expense attending the exploration and
conquest of the western coast of Africa, called Guinea.
Little success had thus far rewarded this undertaking,
nor had he been able to double the Cape of Good
Hope, which name, some say, was given it instead of
Agesingue, its proper designation, because that was
the farthest they hoped to extend their explorations
and conquests, or, as others will have it, because this
cape gave them the expectation of better countries and
navigation. However, the king had but little inclination
to invest any more money in discoveries; and if
he gave any attention to the admiral, it was in consequence
of the excellent reasons he advanced to support
his opinion, which arguments so far convinced the king
that he had nothing else to do but to accept or to
reject the terms which the admiral proposed. For the
admiral, being a noble and magnanimous man, wished
to make an agreement that would be of some personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
benefit and honor to himself, so that he would leave
behind him a notable reputation and a respected family,
such as became his achievements and memory. For
this reason the king, by the advice of one Doctor
Cazadilla,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> whom he greatly esteemed, determined to
send a caravel secretly to attempt that which the admiral
had proposed to him; for if those countries were
in this way discovered, he thought that he would not
be obliged to bestow any great reward which might be
demanded. Having quickly equipped a caravel, he
sent it the way the admiral had proposed to go, for the
vessel was carrying supplies to the islands of the Cape
Verd group. But those he sent had not the knowledge,
perseverance, and energy of the admiral. After wandering
many days on the sea, they turned back to the
islands of Cape Verd, laughing at the undertaking, and
saying that it was unreasonable to think there should
be any land in those waters. This being told to the
admiral, ... he determined to go to Castile
[Spain].... But fearing that, if the king of
Castile should not favor his undertaking, he would be
forced to propose it to some other monarch, thereby
consuming much time, he sent his brother Bartolomé
Columbus, who was with him, to England....
On his way to England, Bartolomé happened to fall
into the hands of pirates, who stripped him and his
companions. For this reason, and being sick and poor
in that country, it was a long time before he could
deliver his message. It was not until he had obtained
some money by making sea-charts that he began to
make certain proposals to King Henry VII., then
reigning, to whom he presented a map of the world....
The king of England, having seen the map<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and heard what the admiral offered to do for him,
readily accepted the overture and ordered him to be
sent for....</p>

<p>“I will not now relate how Bartolomé Columbus
conducted himself in England, but will return to the
admiral, who, about the end of the year 1484, stole secretly
out of Portugal with his son Diego for fear of
being detained by the king; for the king having seen
how unsuited they were whom he had sent with the caravel,
was inclined to restore the admiral to his favor, and
desired that he should renew his proposals; but the
king was not as eager to undertake their consideration
as the admiral was to get away; therefore the king
lost that good opportunity and the admiral entered
Castile to try his fortune which was there to favor him.
Leaving his son in a monastery, called La Rabida, near
Palos, he went at once to the court of the catholic
king, which was then at Cordova, where, being affable
and an entertaining talker, he made friends of such
persons as were most favorably inclined to his undertaking
and fitted to persuade the king to espouse it.
Among these was Luis de Santángel, an Aragonian
gentleman, clerk of the allowances in the king’s household,
a man of great prudence and reputation. As the
undertaking demanded an examination by enlightened
men, and not meaningless words and favor, their highnesses
intrusted the matter to the prior of Prado, afterward
archbishop of Granada, and ordered him, together
with some cosmographers, to make a thorough
investigation of the project and to report their opinions
respecting it.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> But there was only a small number of
cosmographers at that time, and those who were called
together were not as enlightened as they should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
been, nor would the admiral wholly explain his plans,
for fear he might be served as he had been in
Portugal and be deprived of his reward. For this
reason the answers they gave their highnesses were as
different as their judgments and opinions. Some said
that inasmuch as no information concerning those
countries had been obtained by the great number of
experienced sailors living since the creation, which was
many thousand years ago, it was not likely that the
admiral should know more than all the seamen that
were living or that had lived before that time. Others,
who were more influenced by cosmographical reasons,
said the world was so prodigiously great that it
was incredible that a voyage of three years would carry
him to the end of the East, where he proposed to go,
and to substantiate this opinion they brought forward
the statement of Seneca, who, in one of his works, by
way of argument, asserts that many wise men disagreed
about this question, whether or not the ocean were
boundless, and doubted if it could be traversed; and
if it were navigable, whether habitable lands would be
found on the other side of the globe, and whether they
could be reached. They added that only a small part
of this terraqueous globe was inhabited, and that this
was in our hemisphere, and that all the remainder was
sea, and only navigable near the coasts and rivers.</p>

<p>“Some admitted that learned men said it was possible
to sail from the coast of Spain to the farthest
part of the West. Others argued, as the Portuguese
had done, about sailing to Guinea, saying that if any
man should sail directly westward, as the admiral proposed,
that he would not be able to return to Spain on
account of the roundness of the globe, confidently believing
that whosoever should go out of the hemisphere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
known to Ptolemy would go downward, and that then
it would be impossible to return, affirming that it would
be like climbing a hill, which ships could not accomplish
in the stiffest gale. Although the admiral properly
answered all these objections, yet the more cogent
his explanations were the less they comprehended him
on account of their ignorance, for when a man grows
familiar with false principles in mathematics for a long
time he cannot perceive the true, because of the erroneous
impressions which were first imprinted on his
mind. In short, all of these men were governed by
the Spanish saying, St. Augustine doubts it; for this
holy man, in his twenty-first book, chapter ninth, on
the city of God, asserts and considers that it is unreasonable
to believe that there are antipodes, or any
passage from one hemisphere to another.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“They further opposed the arguments of the admiral
by quoting those current fables respecting the
five zones, and other fictions, which they believed were
true. They therefore determined to condemn the enterprise
as foolish and impracticable, and to declare
that it did not become the state and dignity of such
great sovereigns to be misled by such weak information.
Therefore, after much time had been spent in
considering the project, their highnesses answered the
admiral that they were then engaged in too many wars
and conquests, and especially in the conquest of
Granada, which was then occupying their attention,
and therefore it was not convenient for them to espouse
this new enterprise at that time; nevertheless, another
opportunity might be given them when they could
more satisfactorily examine and accomplish that which
he proposed.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Chagrined as he may have been by this second
disappointment, Columbus, with that noble enthusiasm
which the personal consciousness of being in the right
begets, “determined to apply to the king of France,
to whom he had already written concerning the
project, intending, if he were not admitted to an audience
there, to go to England afterward to search for his
brother, from whom he had not yet received any intelligence.
With this resolution he set out for the monastery
of La Rabida, to send his son Diego, whom he
had left there, to Cordova, and then proceed on his
journey. But in order that the thing which God had
decreed should come to pass, it was put in the heart of
Friar Juan Perez, guardian of that house, to befriend the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
admiral, and to be so captivated with his project that he
became deeply concerned respecting his resolution and
the loss Spain would sustain by his departure. Therefore
he entreated the admiral not to proceed any farther,
for he would himself go to the queen, hoping
that, as he was her father-confessor, she would be governed
by what he should say to her. Although the admiral
was disappointed and disgusted with the discreditable
action and judgment of the counsellors of their
highnesses, yet, being on the other hand very desirous
that Spain should reap the benefits of his undertaking,
he complied with the friar’s desire and request, for he
considered himself a Spaniard, as he had long resided
in Spain prosecuting his undertaking and had begotten
children there, which was the reason for his rejection of
the offers made him by other sovereigns, as he declares
in a letter written to their highnesses [of Spain] in these
words: “That I might serve your highnesses, I have
refused to undertake with France, England, and Portugal;
the letters from the sovereigns of which your
highnesses may see in the hands of Doctor Villalan.”</p>

<p>“The admiral departed with Friar Juan Perez from
the monastery of La Rabida, near Palos, and went to
the camp of Santa Fé, where their catholic majesties
were carrying on the siege of Granada. The friar then
had an interview with the queen and so entreated her,
that she consented that the conferences respecting the
discovery should be renewed. But the opinions of the
prior of Prado and those of his followers were discouraging,
besides Columbus desired to be made
admiral and viceroy, and to have other compensations
deemed too considerable to be granted, because if he
succeeded in doing what he proposed, they thought
his demands were too exorbitant, and in case he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
did not accomplish any thing, they considered it
foolish to bestow such titles; consequently the matter
received no favorable decision.... These
things being of such importance, and their highnesses
refusing to grant them, the admiral took leave of his
friends, and proceeded toward Cordova to make preparations
for his journey to France, for he had determined
not to return to Portugal, although the king had
written to him....</p>

<p>“It was in the month of January, in the year 1492,
when the admiral departed from the camp of Santa Fé.
On that same day also Luis de Santángel, previously
mentioned, who did not approve of his going away,
but was very desirous to prevent it, went to the queen,
and using such words as his thoughts suggested to
persuade and enlighten her, said, he was surprised that
her highness, who had always a great fondness for all
matters of moment and consequence should now be
timid in favoring this undertaking, where so little was
hazarded that might contribute in many ways to the
glory of God and the propagation of religion....
The queen, knowing the sincerity of Santángel’s words,
answered, thanking him for his good advice and saying
she was willing to accept the proposals upon the
condition that the undertaking should be delayed until
she had more leisure after the war, and yet, if he thought
differently, she was satisfied that as much money as
was required to fit out a fleet, should be borrowed on
her jewels. But Santángel, perceiving that the queen
had condescended upon his advice to do what she had
refused all other persons, replied that there was no
need of pawning her jewels, for he would do her highness
that small service by lending his money. Thereupon
the queen at once sent an officer post-haste to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
bring the admiral back, who found him upon the bridge
of Pinos, two leagues from Granada. Although the
admiral was much disheartened by the disappointments
and delays he had met with in this undertaking, nevertheless,
being informed of the queen’s wish and intention,
he returned to the camp of Santa Fé, where he
was graciously entertained by their catholic majesties,
and his commission and stipulations were intrusted to
their secretary, Juan de Coloma, who, by the command
of their highnesses, under their hand and seal, granted
him all the conditions and provisions which, as already
mentioned, he had demanded, without altering or subtracting
any thing in them.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sensibly impressed with the importance of his
undertaking, Columbus determined to keep a journal
of such observations and incidents as were most noteworthy
during the voyage. Governed by this intention,
he made the following entry in his log-book,
when he set sail for the remote shores of Cathay:</p>

<p>“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“Whereas the most Christian, high, excellent, and
powerful rulers, the king and the queen of Spain and
of the islands of the sea, our sovereigns, this present
year, 1492, after your highnesses had ended the war
with the Moors ruling in Europe, the same having terminated
in the great city of Granada, where, on the
second day of January, this present year, I saw the
royal banners of your highnesses planted by force of
arms upon the towers of the Alhambra, the fortress of
that city, and beheld the Moorish king come out at the
gate of the city and kiss the hands of your highnesses
and of the prince, my sovereign, and in the present
month, on account of the information which I had given
your highnesses respecting the countries of India
and of a sovereign called the Grand Khan, signifying,
in our language, king of kings; how, at different times,
he and his predecessors had sent to Rome soliciting
instructors to teach him our holy religion, and how the
holy father had never granted his request, whereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
great numbers of people were lost, believing in idolatry
and doctrines of perdition; therefore your highnesses,
as catholic Christians and sovereigns, who love
and promote the holy Christian religion, and are enemies
of the sect of Mahomet, and of all idolatry and
heresy, determined to send me, Christopher Columbus,
(Cristóbal Colon,) to the previously mentioned countries
of India, to see the said sovereigns, people, and
territories, and to learn their disposition and the proper
way of converting them to our holy religion; and furthermore,
directed that I should not go by land to the
East, as is customary, but by a westerly route, in which
direction we have hitherto no certain evidence that any
one has gone. Therefore, after having expelled the Jews
from your dominions, your highnesses, in the same
month of January, ordered me to proceed with a sufficient
armament to the said regions of India, and for
that purpose granted me great favors and ennobled me,
that thereafter I might call myself Don and be high
admiral (<i>almirante mayor</i>) of the sea, and perpetual
viceroy and governor of all the islands and continent
which I might discover and acquire, or which may
hereafter be discovered and acquired in the ocean;
and that this title should be inherited by my eldest
son, and thus descend from generation to generation
forever. Thereupon I left the city of Granada,
on Saturday, the twelfth day of May, 1492,
and proceeded to Palos, a seaport, where I armed
three vessels very fit for such an expedition, and
having provided myself with an abundance of
stores and seamen, I set sail from this port on
Friday, the third of August, half an hour before
sunrise, and steered for the Canary Islands of your
highnesses, which are in the said ocean, thence to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
my departure and proceed till I arrived at the Indies,
and perform the embassy of your highnesses to the
sovereigns there, and discharge the orders given.
Consequently, I have determined to write out daily a
minute account of the voyage respecting what I do and
see, and the passage, as hereafter will appear. Moreover,
sovereign princes, besides recording each night
my progress during the day and the run made during
the night, I intend to make a new nautical chart (<i>carta
nueva de navegar</i>), in which I shall delineate all the sea
and the lands of the Ocean in their proper places under
their wind; and, moreover, I shall compose a book and
represent the whole like a picture by latitude, from the
equator, and by longitude, from the West, wherefore it
will cause me to abstain from sleep and to make many
experiments in navigation, for these things will require
no little labor.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The vessels of the fleet were the ship (<i>la nao</i>), Santa
Maria,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> commanded by Columbus, and two caravels,
(<i>carabelas</i>,) La Pinta, commanded by Martin Alonso
Pinzon, and La Nina, by Vicente Yañes Pinzon, his
brother, both being natives and seamen of Palos.
“Being furnished with all necessaries and ninety men,”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
says Ferdinand Columbus, “they set sail on the third of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
August directly toward the Canaries, and from that time
forward the admiral was very careful to keep an accurate
journal of all that happened to him during the voyage,
specifying the wind that blew, how far he sailed with
it, the currents he found, and what he saw by the way,
whether birds or fishes, or other things....</p>

<p>“The next day after the admiral’s departure for the
Canary Islands, it being Saturday, the fourth of August,
the rudder of one of the caravels, of the one called La
Pinta, broke loose, and the caravel being compelled to
lie to, the admiral soon reached her side, but the wind
blowing hard he could render no assistance, as commanders
at sea are obliged to do to encourage those that are
in distress. This he did more promptly, as he conceived
that the unshipping of the rudder had been brought
about by the contrivance of the master to avoid going
on the voyage, as he had attempted to do before they
set sail.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>At the Canary Islands, Columbus altered the sails
of the caravel La Nina, and made a new rudder for the
Pinta. On Thursday morning, the sixth of September,
the three vessels set sail from the island Gomera, of
the Canary group, “and stood away to the west.” On
the following Sunday, at day-break, when the fleet was
nine leagues west of the island of Ferro,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> the sailors
“lost sight of land, and many, fearing that it would be
long before they should see it again, sighed and wept,
but the admiral, after comforting them with large promises
of land and of wealth, to raise their hopes and
lessen their fears respecting the length of the voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
pretended that by his computation they had sailed only
fifteen leagues that day when they had really run
eighteen, he having determined to keep, during the voyage,
his reckoning short, in order that the men might
not think that they were so far from Spain as they
were, should he openly set down the progress made
which he privately recorded.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>“Continuing his voyage in this way, on Wednesday,
the twelfth of September, about sun-setting,
being about one hundred and fifty leagues west of the
island of Ferro, he discovered a large piece of the
trunk of a tree of one hundred and twenty tons, which
seemed to have been a long time in the water. There
and somewhat farther the current set strongly toward
the northeast. When he had run fifty leagues farther
westward, on the thirteenth of September he found
at night-fall that the needle varied half a point toward
the northeast, and, at day-break, half a point more, by
which he understood that the needle did not point at
the north star, but at some other fixed and visible
point. This variation no man had observed before,
and therefore he had occasion to be surprised at it; but
he was more amazed on the third day after this, when
he was almost one hundred leagues farther, for at night
the needles varied about a point to the northeast, and
in the morning they pointed upon the star.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>As they sailed on this westward course, they found
“more weeds than they had hitherto toward the north
as far as they could see, which weeds were sometimes
a solace to them, believing that they might come from
some land that was near, and sometimes they caused
dread, because they were so thick that in some measure
they impeded the ships, and fear making things worse
than they are, they apprehended that that might happen
to them which is fictitiously reported of Saint Amaro
in the Frozen Sea, which it is said does not suffer ships
to stir backward or forward, and therefore they steered
away from the shoals of weeds as far as possible.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“The wind at this time blew at southwest, sometimes
more and sometimes less west, which, though
contrary to their voyage, the admiral said he considered
a very good wind and a help to them, because the men,
continually grumbling, said that among the things
which increased their fears this was one, for the wind
being always astern, they should never have a gale in
those seas to carry them back; and though sometimes
they found the contrary, they alleged that it was no
settled wind, and that not being strong enough to swell
the sea, it would never carry them back as far as they
had to sail. Although the admiral did whatever he
could to make them cheerful, telling them that the land
being now so near did not permit the waves to rise,
and using the best argument he could, nevertheless he
affirms that he stood in need of God’s special help, as
Moses did when he led the Israelites out of Egypt,
who forbore laying violent hands upon him, because of
the wonders God wrought through him. The admiral
said that he was similarly protected in this voyage. On
the following Sunday the wind began to blow from the
west-northwest, with a rolling sea as the men wished,
and three hours before noon they saw a turtle-dove fly
over the ship, and in the evening they saw a pelican, a
river fowl, and other wild birds, and some crabs among
the weeds; and the next day they espied another pelican,
and several small birds which came from the
west, and small fishes, some of which the men of the
other vessels stuck with harpoons, because they would
not bite at the hook.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>“As often as the men were deceived by these signs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
of land, so often had they occasion to be suspicious
and to grumble and conspire together. They said the
admiral, for a foolish whim, intended to make himself
a great lord at the hazard of their lives, and since
they had done their duty in trying their fortune, and had
gone farther from land and any succor than others had
done, that they ought not to destroy themselves, nor
proceed farther on the voyage, because if they did,
they should have reason to repent, for their provisions
would fall short and the sails of the ships would not
last, which they knew were already so impaired that it
would be difficult to retrace their course from where
they were; and that none would condemn them for
returning, but that they would be regarded as very
brave men for going upon such an expedition and venturing
so far, and that the admiral being a foreigner,
and having nothing at stake, and as many wise and
learned men had condemned his opinion, there would
be nobody now to favor and defend him, and that they
should get more credit than he if they accused him of
ignorance and mismanagement, whatever he should
say for himself. And there were some who said that
to end all dispute, in case he would not consent to
return, that they could make short work of it and throw
him overboard, and report that while he was making
his observations he fell into the sea, and that no man
would trouble himself to inquire into the truth of the
matter; which deed would hasten their return home
and preserve their lives. Thus they conducted themselves
from day to day, grumbling, complaining, and
conspiring together. The admiral was not without apprehensions
of their inconstancy and evil intentions
toward him. Therefore, sometimes with fair words
and sometimes with a strong determination to expose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
his life, putting them in mind of the punishment due
them if they hindered the voyage, he, in some measure,
quelled their fears and suppressed their evil designs.
To confirm the hope with which he had inspired them,
he reminded them of the previous signs and indications,
assuring them that they would soon find land,
which they were so eager to see that they thought
every hour a year until they beheld it....</p>

<p>“On Sunday morning [the thirtieth of September],
four rush-tails came to the ship, and as they flew
there together, it was thought that land was near, especially
when, not long afterward, four pelicans flew
by, and an abundance of weeds was seen, lying in a
line west-northwest and east-southeast, and also a
great number of those fishes they call <i>emperadores</i>,
which have a very hard skin and are not fit to eat.
However much the admiral regarded these signs, still
he never forgot those in the heavens and the course of
the stars. He therefore observed in this place, to his
great astonishment, that the stars of Charles’s wain, at
night, appeared in the west, and in the morning they
were directly northeast, from which he inferred that
their whole night’s course was but three lines or nine
hours—that is, so many parts of twenty-four,—and this
he did every night. He also perceived that at night-fall
the compass-needle varied a whole point to the
northwest, and at day-break it came right with the star.
These things confounded the pilots until he told them
that the cause of it was the circuit the star took about
the pole, which was some satisfaction to them, for this
variation made them apprehend some danger at such
an unknown distance from home, and in such strange
regions....</p>

<p>“On Monday, the first of October, at sunrise, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
pelican came to the ship, and two more about ten in the
morning, and long beds of weeds extended from east
to west. That day, in the morning, the pilot of the
admiral’s ship said that they were five hundred and
seventy-eight leagues west of the island of Ferro. The
admiral said, by his reckoning, they were five hundred
and eighty-four leagues; but in secret he concluded it
was seven hundred and seven, which is one hundred
and twenty-nine leagues more than the pilot reckoned.
The other two vessels differed much in their computations,
for the pilot of the caravel Nina, on the following
Wednesday afternoon, said they had sailed five hundred
and forty leagues, and the other of the caravel
Pinta said six hundred and thirty-four....</p>

<p>“On Thursday afternoon, the fourth of October, a
flock of more than forty sparrows and two pelicans flew
so near the ship that a seaman killed one of them with
a stone; and before this they had seen another bird
like a rush-tail, and another like a swallow, and a great
many flying-fish fell into the vessels. The next day
there came a rush-tail and a pelican from the west, and
great numbers of sparrows were seen.</p>

<p>“On Sunday, the seventh of October, about sunrise,
some signs of land appeared westward, but being
undefined, no one said any thing, for fear of the consequence
of asserting what did not exist, and also for
fear of losing the thirty crowns which their catholic
majesties had promised as an annuity during the life
of him who should first discover land. In order to
prevent the men from crying land, land, at every turn,
as they would likely have done without cause to secure
the gift, it was ordered that whoever said he saw land,
if it were not ascertained to exist in three days from
that time, should lose the reward, even if afterward he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
should be declared to be the first discoverer of land.
All on board of the admiral’s ship being thus forewarned,
none dared to cry out land, but those in the
caravel Nina, which was a better sailer, and kept
ahead, once believing that they actually saw land, fired
a gun, and displayed their colors to indicate land. But
the farther they sailed the more their joyous expectations
diminished and the indication of land disappeared.
However, it pleased God to give them soon after some
comforting assurances, for they saw great flocks of large
fowl and others of small birds flying from the west
toward the southwest. Therefore, the admiral, being
now so far from Spain, and sure that such small birds
would not go far from land, altered his course, which
until that time had been westward, and stood to the
southwest, saying, that his reason for changing his
course was that he would deviate but a little from his
first intention and that he would be following the
example of the Portuguese, who had discovered the
greater number of their islands by means of such birds,
and more especially as the birds he saw flew generally
in the same direction. He also had always proposed
to himself to find land according to the place they were
in; since, as they well knew, he had often told them
that he never expected to find land until he was seven
hundred and fifty leagues westward of the Canary
Islands, within which distance, he had further said, he
should discover Española, which, at this time, he
called Cipango....</p>

<p>“On Monday, the eighth of October, there came
to the ship twelve singing-birds of several colors, and
after flying about the vessel, they held on their way.
They also saw from the vessels many other birds flying
toward the southwest, and that same night great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
numbers of large fowls were seen, and flocks of small
birds coming from the north, and flying after the others.
Besides they saw a good number of tunny-fish. In the
morning they saw a jay, a pelican, some ducks, and
small birds, flying the same way as the others had
done, and they perceived that the air was fresh and
odoriferous, as it is at Seville in April. But they
were now so eager to see land, that they had no faith
in any signs; so that, on Wednesday, the tenth of
October, although they saw a great many birds pass
by during the day and at night, the men did not cease
to complain, or the admiral to censure them for their
want of confidence, declaring to them, that right or
wrong they must go farther to discover the Indies
for which purpose their catholic majesties had sent
them.</p>

<p>“The admiral being no longer able to withstand
the number that opposed him, it pleased God that on
Thursday afternoon, the eleventh of October, the men
took heart and rejoiced, because they had unquestionable
signs that they were near land. Those on board
the admiral’s ship saw a green rush float by the ship,
and then a large green fish of that class which go not
far from the rocks. Those on board the caravel Pinta
saw a cane and a staff, and picked up another staff
curiously wrought, and a small board, and an abundance
of fresh weeds washed from the shore. Those in the
caravel Nina saw similar things, and a branch of a
thorn full of red berries, which seemed to be recently
broken off. By these signs and by his own consciousness,
the admiral, being assured that he was near land,
made a speech to all the men in the evening, after
prayers, reminding them how merciful God had been
in bringing them on so long a voyage with such fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
weather, and comforting them with indications which
every day were plainer and plainer. He begged them to
be very watchful that night, for they were aware that in
the first article of the instructions he had given each ship
at the Canary Islands, that he had ordered that when
they had sailed seven hundred leagues to the west,
without discovering land, that they should lie to from
midnight until daylight. Therefore, since they had not
yet obtained their desires in discovering land, they
should at least manifest their zeal by being watchful.
And inasmuch as he had the strongest assurances of
finding land that night, each should watch in his place;
for besides the annuity of thirty crowns which their
highnesses had promised for a life-time to the one that
first saw land, to the same person he would give a
velvet doublet.</p>

<p>“After this, about ten at night, as the admiral was
in the great cabin, he saw a light on shore, but said it
was so obscure that he could not affirm it to be land,
though he called Pedro Gutierrez, and bid him observe
whether he saw the light, who said he did. Shortly
afterward they called Rodrigo Sanchez, of Segovia, to
look that way, but he could not see it, because he did
not come in time to the place where it might have
been seen. They did not see it more than once or
twice, which induced them to think that it might have
been a candle or a torch belonging to some fisherman
or traveller, who lifted it up and down; or, perhaps,
that it was in the hands of people going from one
house to another, as the light vanished and suddenly
appeared again.... Being now very watchful,
they still held on their course, until about two in the
morning, when the caravel Pinta, which, being an excellent
sailer, was far ahead, gave the signal of land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
which was first discovered by a sailor named Rodrigo
de Triana, when two leagues from the shore. But the
annuity of thirty crowns was not given to him by their
catholic majesties, but to the admiral, who had seen the
light in the darkness, signifying the spiritual light that he
was then spreading in those dark regions. Being now
near land, all the ships lay to, those on board thinking
it was a long time until morning, when they might see
what they had so long desired.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>This island, says Bartolomé de las Casas, the
Spanish historian,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> was “one of the Lucayos, called by
the Indians Guanahani.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Presently they descried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
people, naked, and the admiral landed in the boat,
which was armed, along with Martin Alonso Pinzon
and Vicente Yañez, his brother, captain of the Nina.
The admiral bore the royal standard, and the two captains
each a banner of the green cross, which all the
vessels had carried. The banner was emblazoned with
the initials of the names of the king and queen<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on
each side of the cross, with a crown over each letter.
When they came on the beach, they saw trees very
green, an abundance of water, and fruit of different
kinds. The admiral called the two captains and
the other men who had come on land, and Rodrigo de
Escovedo, notary of the fleet, and Rodrigo Sanchez de
Segovia, and said that he had summoned them to bear
witness that he, before all other men, took possession
(as in act he did) of that island for the king and the
queen, his sovereigns, making the requisite declarations
which are more at large set down in the instrument
which they made there in writing.”</p>

<p>The natives who collected around the Spaniards at
their landing are thus described by Columbus: “I perceived
that if they should have much friendship for us
that it was a people that could be emancipated and converted
to our holy religion better by love than by force.
I gave a number of them some red caps and some beads
of glass, which they placed around their necks, and
many other things of little value, with which they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
much pleased, and they became so friendly that their
attachment seemed strange to us. Afterward they
came swimming to the boats of the ships, where we
were, bringing parrots and thread of cotton in hanks,
javelins, and many other things, which they exchanged
for other articles we gave them, such as glass beads
and little bells. Finally they took every thing and
gave whatever they had with good-will. But to me
they seemed to be a very poor people. They were
all naked, just as they were born, and even the women,
although I did not see but one young girl. All the
rest I saw were youths, but none more than thirty
years of age; very well made, of good shape, and very
attractive faces; their hair coarse as that of the tail of
a horse, and short, brought over the forehead to the
eyebrows, except a little on the back of the head,
which is longer and never cut. Some paint themselves
black, for they are of the color of those of the Canary
Islands—neither black nor white; others paint themselves
white or red, or with any color they find. Some
paint their faces, and some their bodies; others only
their eyes or their noses. They carry no weapons and
they have no knowledge of them; for when I showed
them swords they took them by the edge and they cut
themselves through ignorance. They have no iron.
Their javelins are rods without iron, and some of these
have at the end a fish-tooth, and others have other
things. All of them, as a class, are of a commanding
stature, and are good-looking, well formed. I saw
some marks of wounds on their bodies, and I asked by
signs what had caused them. They answered me in
the same way, that people came from the other islands
thereabout to capture them, and they defended themselves.
I thought then, and still believe, that those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
people came from the continent, (<i>tierra firme</i>,) to take
them prisoners. They ought to be good servants and
very capable, because I perceived that they repeated
very readily all that I told them, and I believe that
they would easily become Christians, for they seemed
to me as if they had no religion. If pleasing to our Lord,
I shall carry from this place, at the time of my departure,
six of them to your highnesses, in order that they may
learn to talk in our language. I did not see any animals
of any kind on the island, except parrots....</p>

<p>“Soon after day-break [on Saturday, the thirteenth
of October,] many of these people came to the beach, as
I have said, all youths and of good stature, a very
handsome people; their hair not curled, but straight
and coarse, like horse-hair, and all with faces and heads
much broader than any other race that I have seen;
their eyes very beautiful and not small; they were
not black, but the color of those of the Canaries,
nor ought it to be expected otherwise, for it is
east-west (<i>Lesteoueste</i>) with the island Ferro of the
Canary group, on the same parallel.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> ... They
came to the ship in canoes, log-boats, made of the
trunks of trees, all of one piece, and fashioned in a
wonderful manner, considering the country. In some
of the large ones were as many as forty or forty-five
men, and in others that were smaller there was only
one person. They rowed with an oar resembling the
wooden shovel used by bakers, and went wonderfully
fast, and if the canoe upset, all swam and set it right
again, bailing it out with calabashes which they carried
with them. They brought balls of spun cotton, and
parrots, and javelins, and other things which it would be
tedious to describe, and which they parted with for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
any thing that was given them. And I was inquisitive
and endeavored to ascertain if they had gold, and I
saw some who wore small pieces hanging from holes
in their noses, and I learned by signs that, by going to
the south, or by going around the island to the south,
I would find a king who had large vessels made of
gold, and great quantities of the precious metal.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Columbus describing this island, which he named
San Salvador (the Holy Saviour), under whose protection
he had made the discovery, continues: “This is
a large and level island, with extremely flourishing
trees, and streams of water. There is a large lake in
the middle of the island, but no mountains. It is
entirely covered with verdure and it is delightful to
behold. The natives are an inoffensive people, and so
desirous to possess any thing they saw with us that
they kept swimming off to the ships with whatever they
could find, and readily bartered for any article we saw
fit to give them in return, even such things as broken
platters and pieces of glass. I saw in this manner sixteen
balls of cotton thread, which weighed about
twenty-five pounds, exchanged for three Portuguese
<i>ceutis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> This traffic I forbade, and permitted no one
to take their cotton from them, unless I should order it
to be procured for your highnesses, if sufficient quantities
could be obtained. It grows on this island, but
from my short stay here I could not inform myself
fully respecting it. The gold they wear in their noses
is also found here. But not to lose time, I am determined
to proceed and ascertain whether I can reach
Cipango (Japan)....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“In the morning, [Sunday, the fourteenth of October,]
I ordered the boats to be manned and furnished,
and coasted along the island toward the north-northeast,
to examine that part of it, for we had landed first
on the eastern part. We soon discovered two
or three villages, and the people all came down to
the shore, calling to us, and giving thanks to
God. Some brought us water, and others food.
Others seeing that I was not disposed to land plunged
into the sea and swam to us, and we observed
that they interrogated us to know if we had come from
heaven. An old man came on board my boat. The
others, both men and women, cried with loud voices:
‘Come and see the men who have come from heaven!
Bring them food and drink!’ Thereupon many of
both sexes came to the beach, every one bringing
something, giving thanks to God, prostrating themselves
on the ground, and lifting their hands to heaven.
They called to us loudly to come on land, but I was
apprehensive on account of a reef of rocks, which,
except where there is a narrow entrance, surrounds the
whole island, although within there is depth of water
and space sufficient for all the ships of Christendom....</p>

<p>“After I had taken a survey of these parts, I
returned to the ship. Setting sail, I discovered so
many islands that I knew not which to visit first.
The natives whom I had taken on board informed
me by signs that there were so many of them that
they could not be numbered. They repeated the
names of more than a hundred. I determined to
steer for the largest, which is about five leagues from
San Salvador; the others were at a greater or less
distance from this island....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“We stood off and on during the night [of
Monday, the fifteenth of October], determining not to
come to anchor till morning, fearing to meet with shoals.
We continued our course in the morning, and as the
island was found to be six or seven leagues distant,
and the tide was against us, it was noon before we
arrived there. I found that part of it, toward San
Salvador, extending from north to south to be five
leagues, and the other side, along which we coasted,
running from east to west, to be more than ten leagues.
From this island, espying a still larger one to the
west, I set sail in that direction and kept on till night
without reaching the western extremity of the island,
where I gave it the name of Santa Maria de la
Concepcion.... I now set sail for another
large island to the west.... This island is
nine leagues distant from Santa Maria, in a westerly
direction. This part of it extends from northwest
to southeast, and it appears to be twenty-eight leagues
long, very level, without any mountains, as were San
Salvador and Santa Maria, having a good shore which
was not rocky, except a few ledges under the water,
where it is necessary to anchor at some distance out,
although the water is clear and the bottom can be
seen....” This island he called Fernandina,
in honor of the king of Spain.</p>

<p>On Friday, the nineteenth of October, he descried
an island, “toward which,” he remarks, “we directed
our course, and before noon all three of the vessels
arrived at the northern extremity, where a rocky islet
and reef extend toward the north, with another between
them and the main island. The Indians on
board the ships called this island Saomete. I named
it Isabela [in honor of the queen]. It lies westerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
from the island of Fernandina, and the coast extends
from the islet twelve leagues west to a cape I called
Cabo Hermoso, for it was a beautiful, round headland,
with a bold shore free from shoals. Part of the shore
is rocky, but the remainder of it, like most of the coast
here, a sandy beach.... This island is the
most beautiful that I have yet seen, the trees in great
numbers, flourishing and tall; the land is higher than
the other islands, and exhibits an eminence, which,
though it cannot be called a mountain, yet it adds a
charm to the appearance of the island, and indicates
the existence of streams of water in the interior.
From this part toward the northeast is an extensive
bay, with many large and dense groves.... I
am not solicitous to examine particularly every thing
here, which, indeed, could not be done in fifty years,
for it is my desire to make all possible discoveries, and
return to your highnesses, if it please our Lord, in
April. However, should I meet with gold or spices in
great quantity, I shall remain till I collect as much as
possible, and for this purpose I am only proceeding in
search of them.” ...</p>

<p>Under the date of Sunday, the twenty-first of
October, while at anchor off the island of Isabela,
Columbus writes: “I shall depart immediately, if the
weather serve, and sail round the island till I succeed
in meeting with the king, in order to see if I can
acquire any of the gold which, I hear, he possesses.
Afterward I shall set sail for another very large island,
which I believe to be Cipango, according to the signs
I receive from the Indians on board. They call the
island Colba [Cuba], and say there are many large
ships and sailors there. Another island they call
Bosio, and inform me that it is very large. The others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
that are on the course I shall examine on the way, and
accordingly as I find gold or spices in abundance, I
shall determine what to do. Nevertheless, I am
determined to proceed to the continent, and visit
the city of Guisay [the city of heaven, the residence
of the Grand Khan], where I shall deliver the letters of
your highnesses to the Grand Khan, and demand an
answer, with which I shall return....</p>

<p>“Tuesday, the twenty-third of October....
It is now my determination to depart for the island of
Cuba, which I believe to be Cipango from the accounts
I have received here of the great number and riches of
the people. I have abandoned the intention of staying
here and sailing round the island in search of the
king, as it would be a waste of time, and I perceive
there are no gold mines to be found.... And
as we are going to places where there is great commerce,
I judge it inexpedient to linger on the way, but
to proceed and survey the countries we meet with, till
we arrive at that one most favorable for our business.
It is my opinion that we shall find much profit there in
spices, but my want of knowledge in these articles
occasions me extreme regret, inasmuch as I see a
thousand kinds of trees, each kind with its particular
fruit, and as flourishing at this time as the fields in
Spain during the months of May and June. Likewise
a thousand kinds of herbs and flowers, of the properties
of which I remain in ignorance, with the exception
of the aloe, which I have directed to-day to be taken
on board in large quantities for the use of your highnesses....</p>

<p>“Wednesday, the twenty-fourth of October....
At midnight weighed anchor and set sail from
Cabo del Isles of the island of Isabela, being in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
north part, where I had remained preparing to depart
for the island of Cuba, in which place the Indians tell
me I shall find great commerce, with abundance of gold
and spices, and large ships, and merchants. They
direct me to steer toward the west-southwest, which is
the course I am holding. If the accounts which the
natives of the islands and those on board the ships
have communicated to me by signs (for their language
I do not understand) are credible, this must be the island
of Cipango, of which we have heard so many wonderful
things. According to my geographical knowledge
it must be somewhere in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the twenty-eighth of October, Columbus’s
ships arrived off the coast of Cuba and “entered
an attractive river, free from shallows and all other obstructions....
The mouth of the river had a
depth of twelve fathoms of water, and a breadth sufficient
for ships to beat in. They anchored within the
river, and the admiral remarks that the scenery here
exceeded in beauty any thing he had ever seen, the
river being bordered with trees of the most beautiful
and luxuriant foliage of a peculiar appearance, and its
banks covered with flowers and fruits of different kinds.
Birds were here in great number singing most
charmingly. Numerous palm trees were seen, different
from those of Guinea and Spain, not having the same
kind of bark. They were of a moderate height and bore
very large leaves, which the natives used to cover their
houses. The land appeared quite level. The admiral
went ashore in a boat, and found two dwellings, which
he supposed to be those of fishermen, and that the
owners had fled. He found in one of them a dog unable
to bark. Both houses contained nets of palm,
lines, horn fish-hooks, harpoons of bone, and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
implements for fishing, as also many fire-places, and each
house seemed sufficiently large to shelter a great number
of people. The admiral gave orders that nothing
should be touched.... They returned on board
the boat and ascended the river some distance....
The admiral declares this to be the most beautiful
island ever seen, abounding in good harbors and deep
rivers, with a shore upon which it appears the sea
never breaks high, as the grass grows down to the
water’s edge, a thing that never happens where the sea
is rough. Indeed, a high sea they had not yet had
among these islands. This island, he says, is full of
attractive mountains, which are lofty, although not of
great range. The rest of the country is high, similar
to Sicily, abounding in streams, as they understood
from the Indians of Guanahani that were on board the
ships, who informed them by signs that it contained
ten large rivers, and that the island was so large that
with their canoes they could not sail round it in twenty
days.... The Indians told them there were
mines of gold here and pearls.... They further
informed him that large vessels came there from
the Grand Khan, and that the main-land was distant a
voyage of ten days. The admiral named the river and
port San Salvador.” Farther westward, along the
northern side of the island, Columbus discovered the
rivers which he called Rio de la Luna (River of the
Moon), and the Rio de Mares (River of Seas). The
houses which were built on the shores of the latter
river, he says, were “the finest he had yet seen, and
thinks, the nearer he approaches the continent, they
will continue to improve. They were of a large size,
built in the shape of a tent, and each collection of them
appeared like a camp, without any order of streets, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
houses scattered here and there. Their interiors were
found very clean and neat, well furnished and set in
order. The houses were all built of fine palm branches.
They found here many statues shaped like women, and
numerous heads somewhat like masks, well made;
whether these were used as ornaments, or objects of
worship, did not appear. Here, about the houses,
were small fowl originally wild, but now tame.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the thirtieth of October, “they sailed
from the river which they had named Rio de Mares, and
standing to the northwest, discovered a cape covered
with palm trees, which the admiral called Cabo de Palmas;
it is fifteen leagues distant from the place of their
departure. The Indians on board the Pinta signified to
the Spaniards, that beyond this cape was a river, and
from this river to Cuba was a distance of a voyage or a
journey of four days. The captain of the Pinta declared
that he understood Cuba to be a city, and that the
land here was a continent of great extent which
stretched far to the north; also that the king of this
country was at war with the Grand Khan, whom the Indians
called Cami, and his country or city, Fava and
other names. The admiral determined to steer for
this river, and to send a present and the letter of the
Spanish sovereigns to the king.... Seemingly
the admiral was forty-two degrees distant from the
equator toward the north, if the manuscript is not corrupted
from which I [Las Casas] have taken this
[information], and he says that he had undertaken to
go to the Grand Khan, who, he thinks, was near
there or in the city of Cathay of the Grand Khan,
which city is very large according to what was told
before he departed from Spain.”</p>

<p>The vessels having returned on Wednesday to the
Rio de Mares from a short exploration of the coast, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
admiral at sunrise, on Thursday, sent some of his men
ashore “to visit the houses they saw there. They
found the inhabitants had all fled, but after some time
they espied a man. The admiral then sent one of his
Indians ashore, who called to him from a distance and
bade him not to fear any harm as the Spaniards were
a friendly people, not injuring any one nor belonging
to the Grand Khan, but on the contrary had made
many presents of their goods to the inhabitants of the
islands. The natives, having ascertained that no ill
treatment was intended them, regained confidence, and
came in more than sixteen canoes to the vessels, bringing
cotton yarn and other things, which the admiral
ordered should not be taken from them, as he wished
them to understand that he was in search of nothing but
gold, which they called <i>nucay</i>. All day the canoes
passed between the ships and the shore. The admiral
saw no gold among them, but remarks that, having observed
an Indian with a piece of wrought silver in his
nose, he conceived it to be an indication of the existence
of that metal in the country. The Indians informed
them by signs that within three days many
traders would come there from the interior to purchase
the goods of the Spaniards to whom the traders would
communicate news of the king, who, as far as could be
learned from the signs of the natives, resided at a
place that was a journey of four days from there.
They informed the Spaniards also that many persons
had been sent to tell the king respecting the admiral.
These people were found to be of the same race and
manners as those already seen, without any religion
that could be discovered. The Spaniards never saw
the Indians who were kept on board the vessels engaged
in any act of worship, but they would, when directed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
make the sign of the cross, and repeat the <i>Salve</i>
and <i>Ave Maria</i>, with their hands extended toward
heaven. The language is the same throughout these
islands and the people friendly toward one another,
which the admiral says he believes to be the case in
all the neighboring parts, and that they are at war with
the Grand Khan, whom they call Cavila, and his country
Bafan. These people go naked as the others....
It is certain, says the admiral, that this is the continent,
and that we are in the neighborhood of Zayto and
Guinsay, a hundred leagues more or less distant from
the one or the other.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>With his thoughts all aglow with his seeming
power to prove the correctness of his geographical
conjecture that he had reached the eastern coast of
Asia, Columbus sent from this place, on the second of
November, Rodrigo de Jerez of Ayamonte, and Luis
de Torres, a Jew, (the latter having lived with the
adelantado of Murcia, and who knew Hebrew, Chaldaic,
and some Arabic,) and two Indians, into the
interior of the island, with letters to the Grand Khan
of Cathay. “He gave them strings of beads to purchase
provisions, and directed them to return within
six days. Specimens of spicery were intrusted to them
that they might know if any thing similar existed in
the country. He took care to instruct them how they
should inquire for the king, and what they were to say
to inform him that the king and queen of Castile had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
dispatched him with letters and a present for his majesty.
Furthermore, the envoys were instructed to obtain
some knowledge of the country, and observe the ports
and rivers, with their distances from the place where
the ships lay. Here the admiral took this night the
altitude with a quadrant, and found that he was forty-two
degrees from the equator, and by his calculation
eleven hundred and forty-two leagues from Ferro, and
he was confident that it was the continent.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Among the noticeable things which the embassadors
observed while journeying into the interior of
Cuba was the common use of tobacco by the natives.
“The two Spaniards,” says Las Casas, “met upon
their journey great numbers of people of both sexes:
the men always with a firebrand in their hands and
certain herbs for smoking. These were dry and were
placed in a dry leaf, after the manner of those paper
tubes which the boys in Spain use at Whitsuntide.
Lighting one end, they drew the smoke by sucking at
the other. This causes drowsiness and a kind of intoxication,
and according to the statement of the natives
relieves them from the feeling of fatigue. These tubes
they call by the name of <i>tabacos</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>While waiting the return of the embassadors to the
Grand Khan, Columbus acquired some knowledge of
the productions of Cuba. “The soil is very fertile, producing
<i>mames</i>, a root like a carrot, tasting like chestnuts.
Beans are also found here but very dissimilar
to ours; also cotton, growing spontaneously among
the mountains. I am of the opinion that it is gathered
at all seasons of the year, for I observed upon a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
plant blossoms, buds, and open pods. A thousand
other productions I have also observed, which doubtless
are of great value, but it is impossible for me to
describe them.”</p>

<p>On the fifth of November, the party sent to the
Grand Khan returned, and gave these particulars of
their journey: “After having travelled a dozen leagues
they came to a town containing about fifty houses,
where there were probably a thousand inhabitants;
each house containing a large number of people. The
houses were built after the manner of large tents. The
inhabitants received them, after their fashion, with great
ceremony. The men and women flocked to behold
them, and they were lodged in their best houses. They
showed their admiration and reverence by touching
the strangers, kissing their hands and feet, and manifesting
astonishment. They imagined them to be from
heaven, and signified as much to them. They were
feasted with such food as the natives had to offer.
Upon their arrival at the town the chief men of the
place led them by the arms to the principal building;
here they gave them seats, and the Indians sat upon
the ground in a circle round them. The Indians who
had accompanied the Spaniards explained to the
natives the manner in which their strange guests
lived, and gave a favorable account of their character.
The men then left the building, and the women entered,
and sat around the Spaniards as the men had
done. They kissed their hands and feet and examined
them to see whether they were flesh and bone like
their own.... No village was seen upon the
road of a larger size than five houses.... Great
numbers of birds were observed, all different from
those of Spain except the nightingales, which delighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
them with their songs. Partridges and geese were
also found in great number. Of quadrupeds they saw
none except dogs that could not bark. The soil appeared
fertile and under good cultivation, producing the
<i>mames</i> already mentioned and beans very dissimilar
to ours, as well as the grain called <i>panic</i>. They saw
large quantities of cotton, spun and manufactured.
A single house contained more than five hundred
<i>arrobas</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> of it. Four thousand quintals might be collected
here yearly.... These people are inoffensive
and peaceable. They are unclothed, but the women
wear a slight covering about their loins. Their manners
are very decent, and their complexion not very
dark, but lighter than the inhabitants of the Canary
Islands. ‘I have no doubt, most serene sovereigns,’
says the admiral, ‘that were some proper, devout, and
religious persons to come among them and learn their
language, it would be an easy matter to convert them
all to Christianity, and I hope in our Lord that your
highnesses will devote yourselves with much diligence
to this object, and bring as great a multitude into the
church, inasmuch as you have exterminated those who
refused to confess the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.’</p>

<p>“I have observed that these people have no religion,
neither are they idolaters, but are a very gentle race,
without the knowledge of any iniquity. They neither
kill, steal, nor carry weapons, and are so timid that one
of our men can put a hundred of them to flight, although
they readily sport and play tricks with them.
They have the knowledge that there is a God above,
and are firmly persuaded that we have come from
heaven. They quickly learn such prayers as we repeat
to them, and also to make the sign of the cross.’ ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“Along the Rio de Mares, which I left last evening,
[Sunday, the eleventh of November,] there is undoubtedly
considerable mastic, and the quantity might be
increased, for the trees when transplanted easily take
root. They are of a lofty size, bearing leaves and fruit
like the lentisk. The tree, however, is taller and has a
larger leaf than the lentisk, as is mentioned by Pliny,
and as I have myself observed in the island of Scio, in
the Archipelago. I ordered many of these trees to be
tapped in order to extract the resin, but as the weather
was rainy all the time I was on the river, I was unable
to procure more than a very small quantity, which I
have preserved for your highnesses.... Great
quantities of cotton might be raised here, and sold
profitably, as I think, without being carried to Spain,
but to the cities of the Grand Khan, which we shall
doubtless discover, as well as many others belonging to
other sovereigns. These may become a source of
profit to your highnesses by trading there with the
productions of Spain and of the other countries of
Europe. Here also is to be found plenty of aloe,
which, however, is not of very great value, but the
mastic assuredly is, as it is found nowhere else than in
the previously mentioned island of Scio, where, if I
rightly remember, it is produced to the amount of fifty
thousand ducats annually.”</p>

<p>Columbus further remarks, that at this point, near
the river which he had called Rio del Sol, “he found
the weather somewhat cold, and, as it was in the winter,
he thought it not prudent to prosecute his discoveries
any farther toward the north.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>Speaking of his explorations along the coast of
Cuba, in his letter to Rafael Sanchez, the admiral says:
“I sailed along its coast toward the west, discovering
so great an extent of territory that I could not imagine
it to be an island, but the continent of Cathay....
I continued on my course, still expecting to meet with
some town or city, but after having gone a great distance,
and not arriving at any, and finding myself
proceeding toward the north, which I was desirous to
avoid on account of the cold, and, moreover, meeting
with a contrary wind, I determined to return to the south,
and therefore put about and sailed back to a harbor that
I had observed.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>On Monday, the twelfth of November, they had
sailed by sunset eighteen leagues, east by south, to a
cape which Columbus called Cabo de Cuba. “On the
following Wednesday he entered a spacious and deep
harbor,” containing so many islands that they could not
be counted.... He declares that it is his opinion
these islands are the innumerable ones which, on
the maps, are placed at the extreme part of the East,
and says that he believes they contain great riches,
precious stones, and spicery, and extend far to the south,
spreading out on each side. He named this place La
Mar de Nuestra Senora, and the port, near the strait
that extends to these islands, Puerto del Principe.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the twenty-first of November,
when the vessels were about eighty miles southeast of
Puerto del Principe, “the admiral” says Las Casas,
“found they were forty-two degrees north of the
equator as at Puerto de Mares,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> but he says here that
he has stopped using the quadrant until he should go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
on land that he might mend it. From this statement
it would seem that he doubted that he was so far from
the equator, and he had reason, for it was not likely
since these islands are in ⸺ degrees.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> To know
whether the quadrant was in good working order, it is
said that he took an observation to see if he was north
as high as Castile; and if this be true, and he was as
high as Florida, what is the situation of the islands
already mentioned?<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Moreover, it is said that the
heat was great. It is evident that if he were along
the coast of Florida, it should not have been hot, but
cold.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> And it is also manifest that in no part of the
world in the latitude of forty-two degrees is great heat
experienced except by some accidental cause, and even
this exception I [Las Casas] believe has never been
known.”</p>

<p>A number of other places were sailed to by the
inquisitive navigator, which, in the chronological order
of their discovery, he named Puerto de Santa Catalina,
Cabo del Pico, Cabo de Campana, and Puerto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Santo. At this last-named harbor, on Saturday, the first
of December, “they planted a cross in the solid rock.”
Thence he sailed to Cabo Lindo, and thence to Cabo
del Monte. On Wednesday, the fifth of December,
“he determined to leave Cuba or Juana,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> which
hitherto he had taken for a continent on account
of its size, having sailed along the coast a hundred and
twenty leagues. He therefore left the shore and
steered southeast by east, as the land last discovered
appeared in that direction. He took this course because
the wind always came round from the north to
northeast, and from there to east and southeast. It
blew hard and they carried all sail, having a smooth
sea and a current favoring them, so that from morning
to one in the afternoon they had sailed eight miles an
hour for nearly six hours. The nights here are said to
be nearly fifteen hours long. After this they went
ten miles an hour, and by sunset had sailed toward the
southeast eighty-eight miles, which are twenty-two
leagues.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, the sixth of December, Columbus
“found himself four leagues from the harbor named
Puerto Maria.” From this place he descried several
headlands to which he respectively gave the names of
Cabo del Estrella, Cabo del Elefante, and Cabo de
Cinquin. “There appeared to be between the two
last-mentioned capes a very wide channel, which the
sailors said separated an island from the mainland.
This island he named Tortuga. The land here appeared
high, and not mountainous, but even and level,
like the finest arable tracts. The whole or the great
part of it seemed to be cultivated, and the plantations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
resembled the wheat fields in the plain of Cordova in
the month of May.”</p>

<p>In the evening the ships entered the harbor
“which he named Puerto de San Nicolas, for it was
the day of that saint.” On Friday he found the harbor
which he named Puerto de la Concepcion. This
harbor “is about a thousand paces or a quarter of a
league wide at the mouth, without a bank or a shoal,
but exceedingly deep to the edge of the beach. It
extends almost three thousand paces, with a fine clear
bottom. Any ship may enter it and anchor without
the least hazard. Here are two small streams, and
opposite the mouth of the harbor several plains, the
most beautiful in the world, resembling those of Castile,
except that they surpass them. On this account
the admiral named the island Española.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, the twelfth of December, “a large
cross was set up at the entrance of the harbor upon a
beautiful spot upon the western side, ‘as an indication,’
in the words of the admiral, ‘that your highnesses
possess the country, and particularly for a memorial of
Jesus Christ, our Lord, and the mark of Christianity.’ ...
The admiral here ascertained the length of
the day and night, and found that from sunrise to sunset
there passed twenty glasses of half an hour each,
although he says there may be some error in the calculation,
as the glass may not have been turned quickly
enough, or the contrary. He states further, that he
took an observation with the astrolabe and found the
latitude to be seventeen degrees....</p>

<p>“The people here were all naked, king as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
as subjects, the females showing no evidences of bashfulness.
Both sexes were more handsome than those
they had hitherto seen. Their color was light, and if
they were clothed and protected from the sun and air
they would almost be as fair as the inhabitants of Spain.
The temperature of the air was cool and exceedingly
pleasant. The land is high, covered with plains
and valleys, and the highest mountains are arable. No
part of Castile could produce a territory comparable to
this in beauty and fertility. The whole island and that
of Tortuga are covered with cultivated fields, like the
plain of Cordova. In these they raise <i>ajes</i>, which are
slips set in the ground, at the end of which roots grow
like carrots. They grate these to powder, knead it,
and make it into bread of a very pleasant taste, like
that of chestnuts. The stalk is set out anew and produces
another root, and this is repeated four or five
times. The largest and most excellent that had been
met with anywhere (the admiral says they are also
found in Guinea) were those of this island, being of the
size of a man’s leg. The natives here, according to the
statement of the admiral, were stoutly built and courageous,
very different from the timid islanders of the
other parts; agreeable in their intercourse and without
any religion.... They saw a native whom the
admiral took to be the governor of the district, and
whom the Indians called the cacique. He had a plate
of gold as large as one’s hand, with which he seemed
desirous of bartering. He carried it to his house and
had it cut into pieces, which he traded away one by
one.”</p>

<p>One of the caciques of the island sent a messenger
to Columbus bearing as a present to him “a girdle, to
which was attached, instead of a pouch, a mask having
the nose, tongue, and ears of beaten gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“I think,” Columbus writes, “no one who has seen
these parts can say less in their praise than I
have said. I repeat that it is a matter of wonder to
see the things we have beheld, and the multitudes of
people in this island, which I call Española, and the
Indians Bohio. The natives are singularly agreeable in
their intercourse and conversation with us, and are not
like the others, who, when they speak, appear to be
uttering menaces. The figures of the men and women
are fine, and their color is not black, although they
paint themselves. The most of them paint themselves
red, others a dark hue, and others different colors, which,
I understand, is done to keep the sun from injuring
them. The houses and towns are very attractive, and
the inhabitants live in each settlement under the rule
of a sovereign or judge, to whom they pay implicit
obedience. These magistrates are persons of excellent
manners and great reserve, and give their orders by a
sign with the hand, which is understood by all the
people with surprising quickness.”</p>

<p>On Monday, the twenty-fourth of December, as
Columbus’s ship, the Santa Maria, was running along
the north side of Española, off the headland named
Punta Santa, “at the end of the first watch, about
eleven at night, when the vessel was about a league distant
from the point of land, the admiral lay down to
sleep, having taken no rest for two days and a night.
As the sea was calm, the man at the helm left his post
to a boy, and also went off to sleep, contrary to
the explicit orders of the admiral, who had throughout
the voyage forbidden, in calm or storm, the helm to be
intrusted to a boy. The admiral was free from any
dread of rocks or shoals, for the Sunday before, when
he sent the sailors in boats to the king who had invited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
him to visit him, they had passed three and a half
leagues to the east of Punta Santa, and had surveyed
the whole coast for three leagues beyond that point,
and ascertained where the vessels might pass, a
thing never done before in the whole voyage. But as
it pleased our Lord, at midnight there being a dead
calm and the sea perfectly motionless, as in a cup, the
whole crew, seeing the admiral had retired, went off to
sleep, leaving the ship in the care of the boy already
mentioned. The current carried her imperceptibly
toward the shoals in the neighborhood, upon which she
struck with a noise that could have been heard a league
off.”</p>

<p>Although every thing was done to keep the damaged
vessel afloat by Columbus and the few men who remained
on board, “she opened between her ribs and
slowly settled down on the shoal.” On the morning of
Christmas the ship was unloaded with the assistance of
the natives, who with their canoes conveyed the goods
in her to the beach. These were afterward stowed in
some houses which the cacique of the region had offered
to Columbus for that purpose. The same ruler afterward
gave the admiral a large mask, with pieces of gold
at the ears, eyes, and other parts of it, and also some
jewels of the same metal. “All these things had a great
effect upon the admiral in assuaging his grief for the
loss of his ship, and he became convinced that our
Lord had permitted the shipwreck in order that he
might select this place for a settlement.</p>

<p>“‘And to this end,’ he says, ‘so many favorable
things conspired, that it cannot be called a disaster, but
a great turn of good fortune, for if we had not run
aground, we should have kept off without anchoring
here, the place being in a large bay inside of two or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
three shoals. Neither should I otherwise have been
induced to leave any men in these parts during the
voyage; even if I had, I could not have spared them the
needful provisions and materials for their fortification.
Many of my crew have solicited me for permission to
remain, and I have to-day [Wednesday, the twenty-sixth
of December] ordered the construction of a fort,
with a tower and a ditch, all to be well built, not that I
think such a fortification necessary as a defence against
the inhabitants, for I have already stated that with my
present crew I could subjugate the whole island, which
I believe to be larger than the kingdom of Portugal,
and twice as populous, but that I think it prudent, since
the territory is at such a distance from our country, and
that the natives may understand the genius of the
people of your highnesses and what they are able to
perform, so that they may be held in obedience by fear
as well as by love. For this purpose I have directed
that a quantity of timber for the construction of the fort
shall be provided, also bread and wine be left to suffice
for more than a year, seed for planting, the long-boat of
the ship, a calker, a carpenter, a gunner, a cooper, and
many other persons of the number of those who have
earnestly desired to serve your highnesses, and oblige
me by remaining here and searching for the gold
mine.’”</p>

<p>The admiral further remarks “that every piece of
the ship was saved, for not even so much as a thong,
board, or nail was lost, for she was as complete as
when she first sailed, except that which was lost by
cutting her to get out the casks and merchandise.
These were carried on shore and well secured, as has
already been mentioned. He adds that he hopes to
find, on his return from Castile, a ton of gold collected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
by those who remained, by trading with the natives,
and that they will have succeeded in discovering the
mine and the spices, and all these in such quantities
that before three years the king and queen may undertake
the recovery of the holy sepulchre. ‘For I have
before proposed to your highnesses,’ he writes, ‘that
the profits of this undertaking should be employed in
the conquest of Jerusalem, at which your highnesses
smiled and said you were pleased, and had the same
inclination.’”</p>

<p>“He left on the island of Española, which the Indians
called Bohio, a fort and thirty-nine men, whom
he states to have been great friends of King Guacanagari.
Over these he placed Diego de Arana, a
native of Cordova, Pedro Gutierrez, groom of the king’s
wardrobe, and Rodrigo de Escovedo, a native of Seville
and nephew of Fray Rodrigo Perez, with all the
powers the king and queen had delegated to him. He
left them all the goods which had been sent for trafficking,
a great quantity, and every thing belonging to the
ship which had been wrecked. The goods he directed
should be traded away for gold.”</p>

<p>In commemoration of the day of Christ’s nativity,
on which his ship was wrecked at this place, he called the
settlement Villa de la Navidad (city of the Nativity).
He further writes in his journal that “he had heard
of another island behind that of Juana, toward the south,
in which there was a still greater quantity of gold, and
where it was found in grains of the size of a bean....
This island was called by the Indians Yamaye.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>“It was the admiral’s intention to coast farther
along the island of Española, which he might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
done upon his homeward course, but as he considered
that the captains of the two caravels were brothers,
namely, Martin Alonso Pinzon and Vicente Yañez, and
that they had a party attached to them, and that they and
their partisans had manifested considerable haughtiness
and avarice, disobeying his commands regardless of the
honors he had conferred upon them, which misdemeanors,
as well as the treachery of Martin Alonso, in
deserting him,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> he had winked at, without complaining,
in order not to throw impediments in the way of the
voyage—he thought it best to return home as quickly
as possible. He adds that he had many faithful men
among his crews, but resolved to overlook for the time
the behavior of the refractory ones, and not at such an
unfavorable season undertake to punish them.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the fifteenth of January, while the
caravels were anchored in the bay which he called the
Golfo de las Flechas (the Gulf of Arrows), he describes
the weapons of the natives. “The bows,” he says,
“are equal in size to those of France and England,
and the arrows like the javelins used by the inhabitants
of the other islands, which are made of the stalks of the
cane while it is in seed. They are very straight, about
a yard and a half in length, and doubled, with a sharp
piece of wood, a span and a half long, at the end. At
the point of this some attach a fish’s tooth, but the
most of them grass.... The bows of the Indians
appear to be made of yew.” The quantity of
sea-weed which he found growing in this bay led Columbus
to infer that the Indies were near the Canary
Islands, not more than four hundred leagues distant.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, the sixteenth of January,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
they set sail from the Golfo de las Flechas, to go to the
island of Carib. “After sailing sixty-four miles, as they
estimated, the Indians on board signified that the island
was to the southeast, when they altered their course,
and proceeded in that direction, and after sailing several
leagues the wind freshened and blew very favorably
for their return to Spain. The crews began to grow
despondent at leaving their homeward course, on account
of the leaky condition of the vessels, (for there
was no remedy for it but the help of God,) and the
admiral found himself constrained to change his course
again, and steer directly for Spain.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Columbus, afterward writing to Rafael Sanchez respecting
his explorations along the coast of Española,
remarks that the island of Española is “greater in circuit
than all of Spain, from Colibre in Catalonia, near
Perpignan, round the coast of the sea of Spain, along
Granada, Portugal, Galicia, and Biscay, to Fuenterabia,
at the cape of Biscay.... Each native, as far as
I can understand, has one wife, with the exception of
the king and princes, who are permitted to have as many
as twenty. The women appear to do more work than
the men. Whether there exist any such thing here
as private property, I have not been able to ascertain.
I have seen an individual appointed to distribute to
the others, especially food and such things.</p>

<p>“People of an extraordinary description I did not
see, neither did I hear of any, except those of the island
Caris, which is the second island on the way from
Española to India. This island is inhabited by a people
who are regarded by their neighbors as exceedingly
ferocious. They feed upon human flesh. These people
have many kinds of canoes with which they make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
incursions upon all the islands of India, robbing and
plundering wherever they go. Their difference from
the others consists in their wearing long hair like that
of women, and in using bows and arrows of cane;
these last constructed, as I have already related, by
fixing a piece of sharpened wood at the larger end.
On this account they are considered very ferocious by
the other Indians, and are much feared by them.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the pecuniary profits of the voyage
Columbus wrote: “I am enabled to promise the acquisition,
by a trifling assistance from their majesties,
of any quantity of gold, drugs, cotton, and mastic,
which last article is found in the island of Scio; also,
any quantity of aloe, and as many slaves for the service
of the marine as their majesties may need. The
same may be said of rhubarb and a great variety of
other things which, I have no doubt, will be discovered
by those I have left at the fort, as I did not stop at any
single place, unless obliged to do so by the weather
with the exception of Villa de la Navidad, where we
remained some time to build the fort and provide the
necessary means for the defence of the place.</p>

<p>“Although the discoveries actually accomplished
appear great and surprising, yet I should have achieved
much more had I been furnished with a suitable fleet.
Nevertheless the great success of this undertaking is
not to be ascribed to my own merits, but to the holy
catholic faith and to the piety of our sovereigns,
the Lord often granting to men what they never
imagine themselves capable of accomplishing, even
that which appears impracticable, for he is accustomed
to hear the prayers of his servants and those who love
his commandments. In this way has it happened to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
that I have succeeded in an undertaking never before
accomplished by man.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday night, the fourteenth of February, a
violent tempest arose, “the waves crossing and dashing
against one another so that the vessel [the Nina]
was overwhelmed, and not able to get out from between
them. The foresail was set very low, in order to carry
her somewhat out of her dangerous situation. They
stood under it for three hours, going twenty miles,
when the wind and sea increasing, they began to drive
before it, not having any other deliverance. At the
same time the Pinta, in which was Martin Alonso
Pinzon, began to scud likewise, and they soon lost sight
of her, although the two caravels made signals to each
other with lights, until from the fury of the storm they
were no longer visible.” The fear of being lost now
overcame Columbus and his men. They prayed and
made many vows. “The admiral ordered that lots
should be cast for one of them [if they safely reached
land] to go on a pilgrimage to Santa Maria of Guadalupe
and carry a wax taper of five pounds’ weight. He
made them all to take an oath that the one on whom the
lot fell should perform the pilgrimage. For this purpose
as many peas were selected as there were persons
on board. One of the peas was marked with a cross,
and all were shaken together in a cap. The first who
put his hand into the cap was the admiral, and he drew
out the crossed pea. So the lot fell on him, and he
considered himself as bound to accomplish the pilgrimage.
Another lot was taken for a pilgrimage to
Santa Maria of Loretto, in the province of Ancona,
the territory of the pope, where is the house in which
Our Lady has performed so many miracles. This lot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
fell on a sailor of Puerto de Santa Maria, called Pedro
de Villa. The admiral promised to furnish him with
the money for his expenses. A third lot was determined
upon for the selection of a person who should
watch a whole night in Santa Clara de Moguer, and
have a mass said there. This lot fell on the admiral.
After this he and all the crew made a vow to go in
procession, clothed in penitential garments, to the first
church dedicated to Our Lady which they should meet
with on arriving on land, and there pay their devotions.
Besides these general vows, every individual made a
private one, all expecting to be lost, so terrible was the
violence of the hurricane. Their danger was increased
by the want of ballast in the vessel, ... which
the admiral had neglected to supply among the islands,
because he wished to husband his time in making discoveries,
and expected to take in ballast at the island
of Matinino, which he intended to visit. The only
thing that they could do in this emergency was to fill
with sea-water such empty casks as they could find,
and by doing this they obtained some relief.</p>

<p>“Here the admiral speaks of the circumstances
which caused him to fear that our Lord would suffer
them to perish, and of some which made him hope
that he would bring them safe to land, and not allow
the important information they were carrying to the
king and queen to be lost. He seems to have felt
the greatest anxiety to have his wonderful discovery
known, so that the world might be convinced that his
assertions had been correct and that he had accomplished
what he had professed himself able to do. The
thought of this not being done gave him the greatest
disquietude, and he was constantly apprehending that
the most trifling thing might defeat his whole intention.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
He ascribes this to his want of faith and confidence in
a divine providence, but comforts himself by reflecting
upon the many mercies God had shown him in having
enabled him to succeed in his project, when so many
adversities and hindrances opposed him in Castile, and
afterward to accomplish his great discovery. And as
he had made the service of God the aim and business
of his undertaking, and as he had hitherto favored him
by granting all his desires, he indulges in the hope that
he will continue to favor him, and will give him a safe
return. He also remembered that God had delivered
him on the outward voyage, when he had much greater
reason to fear; that the eternal God gave him resolution
and courage to withstand his men when they
conspired against him and with a unanimous and
menacing determination resolved to turn back. With
these thoughts, and the consideration of other wonderful
favors he had enjoyed, he says he ought not to be
in fear of the tempest; but he adds that his apprehensions
and the anguish of his mind would not allow him
to rest. Besides, he continues, his anxiety was increased
by reflecting upon the condition of his two
sons whom he had left at their studies in Cordova,—these
would be left orphans in a foreign land, and the
king and queen being ignorant of the services he had
rendered them by the voyage, would not feel any
inclination to provide for them. On this account, and
that their highnesses might be informed that our Lord
had granted success to the undertaking in the discovery
of the Indies, and might know that storms did not prevail
in those regions (which was apparent from the
plants and trees growing down to the brink of the sea),
he devised the means of acquainting them with the
circumstances of the voyage in case they should perish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
in the storm. This he did by writing an account of it on
parchment, as full as possible, and earnestly entreated
the finder to carry it to the king and queen of Spain.
The parchment was rolled up in a waxed cloth and
well tied. A large wooden cask being brought, he
placed the roll inside of it, and threw the cask into
the sea, none of the crew knowing what it was, but all
thinking that it was some act of devotion.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>On the sixteenth of February the Nina reached the
Azores, and two days afterward was riding at anchor at
the island of Santa Maria. Departing from the Azores
on the twenty-fourth of February, the Nina again encountered
another storm, which caused Columbus to
take refuge in the mouth of the river Tagus, on the
fourth of March. From this roadstead he sent a
courier overland to Spain bearing the intelligence of
his arrival at this haven on the coast of Portugal, and
another to the king of Portugal to ask permission to
anchor in the harbor of Lisbon.</p>

<p>When, on the sixth of March, it became known in
Lisbon, says Ferdinand Columbus, “that the ship came
from the Indies, such throngs of people went aboard
to see the Indians and to hear the news, that the vessel
could not contain them, and the water was covered
with boats, some of the people praising God for the
success of so great an undertaking, and others storming
because the Portuguese had lost the discovery through
the king’s incredulity.... The next day the
king wrote to the admiral congratulating him on his
safe return, and expressing the desire, since the admiral
was in his dominions, that he would visit him [at Valparaiso,
nine leagues from Lisbon].... The
king ordered all the nobility of his court to go out to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
meet him, and when the admiral came into the presence
of the king, he honored him by commanding him
to put on his cap and to sit down. The king, having
heard the particulars of his fortunate voyage, offered
him all he stood in need of for the service of their
catholic majesties, although he thought that as the
admiral had been a captain in the service of Portugal,
that the discovery belonged to him. To which the admiral
answered that he knew of no agreement by which
he could obtain it, and that he had strictly obeyed his
orders, which were that he should not go to the mines
of Portugal or to Guinea. The king said that it was
all well, and he did not doubt but justice would be
done. Having spent considerable time in this conversation,
the king commanded the prior of Crato, the
greatest man then about him, to entertain the admiral,
and show him all civility and respect, which was done
accordingly. Having remained there all Sunday, and
all Monday until after mass, the admiral took leave of
the king.... As he was on his way to Lisbon,
he passed a monastery, where the queen was, who sent
him an earnest entreaty that he would not pass by without
seeing her. She was much pleased to see him, and
bestowed upon him all the favor and honor that were
due to the greatest lord. That night a messenger came
from the king to the admiral, to inform him that if he
wished to go by land to Spain he would attend him,
provide lodgings on the way, and furnish him all that
he might require, as far as the borders of Portugal.</p>

<p>“On Wednesday, the thirteenth of March, two
hours after daylight, the admiral set sail for Seville,
and, on Friday following, at noon, arrived at Saltes,
and came to anchor in the port of Palos,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
he had departed on the third of August, the previous
year, 1492, seven months and eleven days preceding
his return.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Desiring as early as possible to make known his
return and his remarkable discoveries, Columbus, as
soon as his vessel came to anchor, sent letters to several
of his friends, in which he gave brief descriptions of
the people and of the islands which he had found, as
he believed, in the eastern part of Asia. One of these
letters, that addressed on the fourteenth of March to
Rafael or Gabriel Sanchez, treasurer of Spain, was
shortly afterward translated into Latin and printed at
Rome. The title given to the letter expresses the
popular belief respecting the situation of the discovered
islands: “A letter of Christopher Columbus, to whom
our age is greatly indebted, respecting the islands of
India lately found beyond the Ganges.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Conscious of the greatness of his discovery, Columbus
enthusiastically closes his letter with these words:
“And now the king, the queen, the princes, and all
their dominions, as well as the whole of Christendom,
ought to give thanks to our Saviour, Jesus Christ, who
has granted us such an achievement and success. Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
processions be ordered, let solemn festivals be celebrated,
let the churches be filled with boughs and
flowers.”</p>

<p>When his father landed at Palos, “he was received
there,” says Ferdinand Columbus, “by all the people
in procession, giving thanks to God for his fortunate
success, which, it was hoped, would contribute greatly
to propagate the Christian religion and enlarge their
majesties’ dominions. All the inhabitants of the place
considered it a matter of no little fame that the admiral
had sailed from that port, and that most of the men he
had with him belonged to it, though many of them,
through [Martin Alonso] Pinzon’s fault, had been mutinous
and disobedient.... The admiral then
proceeded toward Seville, intending to go from there
to Barcelona where their catholic majesties were. He
was compelled to tarry a little along the way thither,
though it were ever so little, to satisfy the curiosity of
the people where he went, who came from the neighboring
towns to the road along which he journeyed to
see him, the Indians, and the other things he brought.
Proceeding in this manner, he reached Barcelona about
the middle of April, having previously sent their highnesses
an account of the good fortune attending his
voyage, which exceedingly pleased them, and they appointed
him a most impressive reception as a man that
had performed for them an extraordinary commission.
All the court and city went out to meet him. Their
catholic majesties sat in public in great state, on costly
chairs, under a canopy of gold-cloth; and when he approached
to kiss their hands they arose as to a great
lord, and were unwilling to give him their hands, and
caused him to sit down by them. When he had given
them a brief account of his voyage, they permitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
him to retire to his apartment, to which he was attended
by all the court. And he was so highly
honored and favored by their highnesses, that when
the king rode about Barcelona, the admiral was on one
side of him, and the Infante Fortuna on the other, for
before this, no one rode by the side of his majesty but
the Infante, who was his near kinsman.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Galvano, speaking of the enthusiasm created by
Columbus’s return, says: “Hereupon there arose so
extraordinary a desire to travel among the Spaniards
that they were ready to leap into the sea to swim, if it
had been possible, unto these new lands.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Spanish sovereigns, in order to obtain the
privilege of extending their sway over the islands discovered
by Columbus, immediately sent embassadors
to Rome to request Pope Alexander VI. to confirm
the title of Spain to the recently found lands, for it
was then believed that the pope had sole and absolute
authority to dispose of all countries inhabited by
heathen peoples. Pope Martin V. and his successors
had already granted to the crown of Portugal the
possession of all the lands it might acquire by right of
discovery beyond Cape Bojador toward the East. Pope
Alexander VI., to reward the Spaniards for wresting
Spain from the Moors, issued a bull, on the fourth of
May, 1493, establishing a line of limitation, running
from the north to the south pole, distant one hundred
leagues west of the Azores and the Cape Verd Islands,
giving to Spain all the lands she had discovered or
might discover west of it, which had not been acquired
by any Christian power before the preceding Christmas,
and to Portugal all the territory, on the same
conditions, which lay east of it. These territorial concessions
of the pope caused the possessions of Spain,
in the western hemisphere, to be called the West Indies,
and those of Portugal, in the eastern hemisphere,
the East Indies. The position of the line of demarkation
displeased the Portuguese. To settle the dispute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
which it caused, the two countries sent commissioners
to Tordesillas, Spain, who agreed, on the seventh of
June, 1494, that the position of the line should be
changed so that it should pass, north and south, three
hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verd
Islands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Spain a fleet of seventeen ships had
been fitted out to sail to the Indies in the West. About
fifteen hundred Spanish adventurers took passage on
the different vessels, which were freighted with agricultural
and mining implements, horses, cattle, and
stores of various kinds, necessary for planting colonies
on the newly-discovered islands. Commanded by
Columbus, the fleet weighed anchor in the roadstead
of Cadiz, on Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of September,
1493, and thence sailed toward the West India
archipelago.</p>

<p>After a voyage of thirty-eight days the fleet reached
the island of Dominica. The approach of Columbus
to the field of his former explorations is thus described:
“On Saturday night, the second of November, the
admiral perceiving a great change in the sky and
winds, and having observed the heavy rains, and believing
that he was near land, ordered most of the sails
to be furled, and commanded all to be upon the watch,
and not without cause for that same night, at daybreak,
land was descried seven leagues to the westward,
a high mountainous island, which he called
Dominica (Sunday), because it was discovered on
Sunday morning. Shortly afterward he saw another
island, northeast of Dominica, and then another, and
another after that, more northward. For this blessing
which God had been pleased to bestow on them, all
the men assembled on deck and sang the <i>Salve Regina</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and other prayers and hymns very devoutly, giving
thanks to God, because in twenty days after departing
from Gomera, [one of the Canary Islands,] they had
made that land, estimating the distance between them
to be between seven hundred and fifty and eight hundred
leagues. Finding no convenient harbor in which
to anchor on the east side of Dominica, they stood for
another island, which the admiral called Marigalante,
which was the name of his ship.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Thence he proceeded
northward “to a large island which he called
Santa Maria de Guadalupe, to honor her and the
request of the friars of the house of that name, to
whom he had made promise to call some island by the
name of their monastery.... Going ashore in
the boat to view a village which they had observed,
they found none of the inhabitants in it, the people
having fled to the woods, except some children to
whose arms they tied some baubles to allure their
fathers when they returned. In the houses they found
geese like ours, a great number of parrots, with red,
green, blue, and white feathers, as large as common
cocks. They also found pumpkins, and a kind of fruit
which looked like our green pine-apples, but much
larger, and inside full of solid substance like a melon,
and much sweeter both in taste and smell, that grew
on long stalks like lilies or aloes, wild about the fields....
They also saw other kinds of fruit and herbs
different from ours; beds of cotton nets (<i>hamacas</i>),
bows and arrows, and other things....</p>

<p>“The next day, which was Tuesday, the fifth of
November, the admiral sent two boats ashore to
capture some natives who might give him a description
of the country, and tell him how far off and in what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
direction Española lay. Each boat brought back a youth.
The youths agreed in saying that they were not of that
island, but of another called Borriquen, and that the
inhabitants of that island of Guadalupe were Caribbees
or cannibals, and had taken them prisoners from their
own island. Soon after the boats returning to shore,
to take up some Christians they had left there, six
women were found with them, who had fled from the
Caribbees, and came of their own accord aboard the
ships.... One of the women told them that
toward the south there were many islands, some inhabited,
others not, which both she and the other
women, severally called Giamachi, Cairvaco, Huino,
Buriari, Arubeira, Sixibei. But the continent, which
they said was very great, both they and the people
of Española called Zuanta [Yucatan?], because in
former times canoes had come from that land to
barter.... The same women gave them information
where the island of Española lay; for though
the admiral had inserted it in his sea-chart, yet for his
further information he desired to hear what the people
of that country said of it.... Then the admiral
landed and went to some houses, where he saw ...
a great deal of cotton, spun and unspun, looms to
weave, a great number of men’s skulls hung up, and
baskets filled with men’s bones.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>On his way to the island of Española, Columbus
discovered an island which he called San Juan Baptista,
but the Indians, Borriquen. On the twelfth of November
he arrived off the north coast of Española.
On Thursday, the twenty-eighth of the same month,
the discoverer with his fleet entered the harbor of
the Villa de la Navidad, and found the place burnt and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
deserted. The next morning “the admiral landed,
much concerned to see the houses and fort in ashes
and nothing left belonging to the Christians except
some ragged clothing and similar things as are found
in a place plundered and destroyed. Seeing no one
to question, the admiral went up a river that was near
with some boats.... Having found nothing
but some of the clothing of the Christians, he returned
to Navidad, where he saw the bodies of eight Christians,
and of three other persons in the fields, whom
they recognized by their clothing, and they seemed to
have been dead about a month. While the Christians
were searching for some other tokens or writings of
the dead, a brother of the cacique, Guacanagari, came
with some Indians to talk with the admiral. These
could speak some words of Spanish, and knew the
names of all the Christians that had been left there.
They related that the latter soon began to quarrel
among themselves, and each to take as much gold and
as many women as they could obtain. Pedro Gutierrez
and Escovedo thereupon killed a person named Diego,
and then they and nine others went away with their
women to a cacique, whose name was Caunaboa, who
was lord of the mines, and he killed them all. Then
many days afterward he came with a great number of
men to Navidad, where there was only Diego de
Arana with ten men, who had remained with him to
guard the fort, all the others being dispersed about the
island. The cacique, Caunaboa, coming there at night,
set fire to the houses where the Christians lived with
their women, and the Christians, being frightened, fled
to the sea, where eight were drowned, and three died
ashore, whose bodies they showed to them. Guacanagari
undertook to defend the Christians, but he and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
his men were wounded and were compelled to flee for
their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>About the ninth of December Columbus sailed eastwardly
from the site of the Villa de la Navidad, and
anchored before an Indian town, where he determined
to plant a colony. “He landed with all his men, provisions
and implements, which he had brought in the
ships of the fleet, at a plain, near a rock, on which a
fort could easily be built. Here he erected a town,
and called it Isabela, in honor of Queen Isabella. This
place was deemed very suitable, inasmuch as the
harbor was very large, though exposed to the northwest,
and had an attractive river a bow-shot from it,
from which canals of water might be cut to run through
the middle of the town, and beyond was an extensive
plain, from which the Indians said the mines of Cibao
were not very distant. For these reasons the admiral
was eager to settle the colony. On account of the
fatigue of the voyage and that caused by his labor
here, he did not have time to write in his journal, from
day to day, what happened, as had been his habit.
He also fell sick, which interrupted his writing from
the eleventh of December to the twelfth of March,
1494. Meanwhile he administered the affairs of the
town according to his ability. He intrusted Alonso de
Hojeda with fifteen men to discover the mines of
Cibao. Afterward, on the second of February, twelve
ships of the fleet set sail for Castile, under the command
of Antonio de Torres.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>In March Columbus with a body of armed men explored
the country of Cibao. “It is rough and stony,”
writes Ferdinand Columbus, “full of gravel, grassy,
and watered by several rivers in which gold is found.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
The farther they went into the country the more
rugged and mountainous they found it. On the tops
of the mountains were grains of gold-sand, for, as the
admiral said, the great rains carry it down from the
summits of the mountains to the rivers in small sand....
The admiral, perceiving that he was now
eighteen leagues from Isabela, and the country he had
left behind him very craggy, ordered a fort to be built
in a very pleasant and defensible place, which he called
the castle of San Tomas, to command the country
about the mines, and to be a place of safety for the
Christians who went there. The command of this new
fort he gave to Don Pedro Margarita, a person of
some importance, with fifty-six men, among whom
were men of all trades to erect the fort, which was
built with clay and timber, which made it strong
enough to resist the attack of any number of Indians
that might come against it.... On Sunday,
the twenty-ninth of March, Columbus arrived at Isabela,
where melons were already grown fit to eat,
although it was not more than two months after the
seed had been put into the ground. Cucumbers came
up in twenty days, and a wild vine of that country,
having been pruned, had produced grapes which were
good and large. The next day, being the thirtieth of
March, a farmer gathered ears of wheat, the seed of
which he had sown at the latter end of January.
There were also pease, but much larger than those
they sowed. All they sowed came up above the
ground in three days, and on the twenty-fifth day they
were eating them. The stones of fruit set in the
ground sprouted in seven days, and vine branches
shot out in the same time, and in twenty-five days
thereafter they gathered green grapes....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“The admiral, having determined to go to discover
the continent, appointed a council to govern the island
in his absence. The persons composing it were Don
Diego Colon, the admiral’s brother, with the title of
president; F. Boyl [Friar Buil] and Pedro Fernandez
Coronel, regents; Alonzo Sanchez de Carvajal, rector
of Bacca, and Juan de Luxan, gentlemen of their
catholic majesties.... On Tuesday, the twenty-ninth
of April, the wind being favorable, Columbus
arrived at Cabo de San Nicolas, and thence crossed
over to the island of Cuba, running along the south
coast of it, and having sailed a league beyond Cabo
Fuerte, he put into a large bay which he called Puerto
Grande....</p>

<p>“On Saturday, the third of May, the admiral resolved
to sail from Cuba over to Jamaica, that he might
not leave it behind without knowing whether the report
of the abundance of gold there were true. The
wind being favorable, he discovered it on Sunday,
when he was less than half the distance to it. On
Monday he came to anchor, and thought it was the most
attractive of all the islands which he had seen in the
Indies. So many people, in large and small canoes,
came aboard his vessels that it was quite astonishing.
The next day he ran along the coast to search for
harbors. When the boats went to examine the
havens, there came out so many canoes and armed
men to defend the country, that the men in the
boats were forced to return to the ships, not through
fear, but to avoid making enemies of them....
On Tuesday, the thirteenth of May, Columbus determined
to stand over again for Cuba to coast
along it, intending not to return until he had sailed
five or six hundred leagues, and was satisfied whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
it were a continent or an island.... On
Friday, the thirteenth of June, the admiral perceiving
that the coast of Cuba ran far to the west, and that
it was a matter of the greatest difficulty to sail that
way on account of the infinite number of islands and
sand-bars that were on all sides of them, and he also
beginning to be in want of provisions, for which reason
he could not continue his voyage as he had intended,
he determined to return to the town he had begun to
build in Española. To supply himself with wood and
water, he anchored at the island Evangelista, which is
thirty leagues in circuit, and seven hundred from Dominica.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>While Columbus was exploring the coast of Cuba,
near the island of Evangelista, on the twelfth of June,
it is said that he, for the purpose of furnishing indisputable
evidence that he had reached the dominions of
the Grand Khan, sent Fernando Perez de Luna, his
notary, with four attesting witnesses, to the vessels,
and had each person on board to make a declaration
under oath that he was convinced that the land he saw
was a part of the continent of Asia, and that he believed
any one could go from it by land to Spain.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The
notary, when taking the depositions, it is said, informed
each person giving this testimony, that should he for
any malicious purpose afterward assert a different
opinion, he would, if an officer, be made to pay a
penalty of ten thousand maravedis for such an offence,
and if a person of lower rank, he would receive a
hundred lashes and have his tongue cut out.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
as it seems, it was Columbus’s belief that this watery
expanse was really the gulf of the Ganges.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Departing from the island of Evangelista, Columbus
returned along the coast of Cuba to Cabo de Santa
Cruz, from which he steered to the island of Jamaica.
After leaving it, he discovered the two islands lying
off the east coast of Española, called respectively by
the Indians Adamanai and Mona. On the twenty-ninth
of September, 1494, he returned to Isabela.</p>

<p>The people of the island of Española having
acquired some knowledge of the Spanish language,
were able at this time to give Columbus considerable
information respecting their religion. From his conversations
with them he was enabled to write the
following account of their peculiar image-worship:
“I could discover neither idolatry nor any sect among
them, though each one of their kings, who are very
many, as well in Española as on all the other islands
and continent, has a house apart from the town, in
which there is nothing but some carved, wooden
images that are called <i>cemies</i>. There is nothing
done in these houses but what is for the service of the
<i>cemies</i>, to which they repair to perform certain ceremonies,
and pray there, as we do in our churches.
In these houses they have a handsome, round table,
made like a dish, on which is some powder, which
they lay on the heads of the <i>cemies</i> with a certain
ceremony. Then through a cane, that has two
branches, held to their own nostrils they snuff up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
this powder. The words they use none of our people
understand. The powder intoxicates them, and they
act as if they were drunk. They also give the image
a name, and I believe it is that of their father or
grandfather, or both; for they have more than one,
and some more than ten, all in memory of their forefathers,
as I have already said. I have heard them
praise one more than another, and have observed
them to have more devotion, and show more respect
to one than another, as we do in processions in time
of want; and the people and the caciques boast
among themselves of having the best <i>cemies</i>. When
they go to these <i>cemies</i> they shun the Christians, and
will not permit them to enter these houses. If they
suspect that they will come, they take their <i>cemies</i>
and hide them in the woods for fear that they should
be deprived of them. What is most ridiculous, they
have the habit of stealing one another’s <i>cemies</i>. It
happened once that the Christians suddenly rushed
into a house with them, and the <i>cemi</i> cried out, speaking
in their language, which showed that it was artificially
made. The <i>cemi</i> being hollow, they had attached
a tube to it, which tube extended to a dark
corner of the house, where a man was concealed with
boughs and leaves who had spoken through the tube
the words which the cacique had commanded him.
The Spaniards, suspecting something of the kind,
kicked down the <i>cemi</i>, and discovered that which has
been related. The cacique seeing that his deception
was known to the Spaniards, earnestly begged them
not to speak of it to his subjects or to the other
Indians, because he made them obedient by this artifice....
Three large stones are also in the
possession of almost all the caciques, which are highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
venerated by them and their people. The one they say
makes the corn and the grain to grow, the second
helps women in travail, and the third procures rain or
fair weather, whenever they desire to be benefited in
any one of these ways. I sent your highnesses three
of these stones by Antonio de Torres, and have three
more to bring with me.</p>

<p>“When these Indians die, they have several ways
of performing their obsequies. The manner in which
they bury their caciques is as follows: They open his
body and dry it at a fire in order to preserve it. Of
other persons they only take the head. They bury some
in caves or caverns, and place gourds of water and
bread at their heads. Others they burn in the house
where they die, and they do not permit them to
die naturally, but strangle them at their last gasp.
This is done to the caciques. Others are turned out
of the house, and are put in a <i>hamac</i>, which is their
bed, with bread and water at their heads, and they are
never visited again. Some who become dangerously
ill are carried to the cacique, who tells whether they
are to be strangled or not, and what he commands is
done. I have taken pains to learn what they believe,
and whether they know what becomes of them after
they are dead. This I inquired of Caunaboa, who was
the principal king of Española, an aged man, intelligent
and of much discernment. He and the rest
answered that they go to a certain valley, which every
great cacique supposes to be his country, where, they
affirm, they find their parents and all their ancestors;
that they eat, have women, and enjoy themselves in
pleasures and pastimes.</p>

<p>“The admiral, having brought the island into a
peaceable condition, and built the town of Isabela, besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
three forts in different parts of the country, determined
to return to Spain.... He went on
board, on Thursday, the tenth of March, 1496, with two
hundred and twenty-five Spaniards and thirty Indians,
and sailed from Isabela, at daybreak, and steered along
the coast with two caravels, one called Santa Cruz, the
other La Nina, the same in which he went to discover
the island of Cuba.... Having supplied himself
with bread, wood, and water, he set sail on
Wednesday, the twentieth of April, from the island of
Guadalupe, with the wind very scant, keeping near
the latitude of twenty-two degrees, for at that time
they had not found out the way of running away north
to catch the southwest winds.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>After sailing a month in the direction of Spain,
“although there were eight or nine pilots on board the
two vessels, yet none of them knew where they were;
but the admiral was confident that they were only a
little west of the Azores.”</p>

<p>Columbus, speaking of the movements of his compasses
at this time, observes: “This morning the
Dutch compasses varied, as they formerly did, a point;
and those of Geneva, which previously agreed with
them, varied only a little, but after sailing east varied
more, which is a sign that we are one hundred leagues
or more west of the Azores, for when we were just one
hundred there were only a few weeds scattered in the
sea, and the Dutch needles varied a point, those of
Geneva cutting the north point, and when we are a
little farther east-northeast they will alter again.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
These noticeable differences in the variations of the
needles, Ferdinand Columbus says, the admiral assigned
to “the different kinds of loadstones used in making
them.” ... “In this way,” he remarks, “they
continued their voyage, though all the pilots went like
blind men.” Columbus, when near Spain, confidently
asserted that they would be in sight of the coast on the
following morning, which proved to be true, “for which
reason he was looked upon by the seamen as very expert
and almost prophetic in sea affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> On Saturday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the eleventh of June, 1496, the caravels arrived
in the port of Cadiz.</p>

<p>“The admiral,” as soon as he had landed, “began to
prepare for his journey to Burgos, where he was favorably
received by their catholic majesties, who were
there celebrating the nuptials of Prince Juan, their son,
who married Margarita of Austria.”</p>

<p class="caption">ON MERCATOR’S PROJECTION.</p>
</div>

<p>While Columbus was in Española, King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella abrogated in part the concessions
granted him, and issued letters-patent on the tenth of
April, 1495, permitting any of their subjects to make
voyages of discovery to the Indies.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Commissioned by
their highnesses, Amerigo Vespucci<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> went with a fleet
of four vessels, in 1497, to make discoveries. The account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
of the voyage is contained in a letter written by
him, in Lisbon, on the fourth of September, 1504. The
publication of it made him famous as the discoverer of
the continent of America. Singular as it is true, the
palpable discrepancies found in the subsequent versions
of Vespucci’s letter have led many scholars to discredit
the statements of the intelligent and enterprising Italian.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Vespucci thus writes respecting his first voyage:</p>

<p>“The king, Don Ferdinand of Castile, having
ordered four ships to discover new lands toward the
west, I was selected by his highness to go in the fleet
to aid in the discoveries.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> We departed from the port
of Cadiz on the tenth day of May, 1497, and took our
course across the great gulf of the ocean-sea.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> We
spent eighteen months on the voyage, and discovered
much main-land and an endless number of islands,
which were in great part inhabited. As these are not
spoken of by ancient writers, I think that they had no
knowledge of them....</p>

<p>“We reached a land which we judged to be firm
land, distant from the Canary Islands about a thousand
leagues more to the west, within the torrid zone,
because we found the north pole at an elevation of
sixteen degrees above the horizon,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and that we were
more than seventy-five degrees west of the Canary
Islands as our instruments showed.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> We anchored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
our ships a league and a half from the coast. We got
out our boats, and, having manned and armed them,
we went on land.</p>

<p>“Before we went ashore we were greatly delighted
in seeing many people wandering along the beach.
We saw that they were naked and that they seemed
to be frightened when they beheld us, likely, as I supposed,
by seeing us clothed, and of a different stature
from their own. They retired to a mountain, and we
could not entice them to hold any intercourse with us,
notwithstanding we endeavored to induce them by
signs of peace and friendship....</p>

<p>“We sailed to the northwest<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> in which direction the
coast extended, always in sight of land, seeing continually,
during the voyage, people on the shore. After
sailing two days, we found a secure place for the ships,
and anchored half a league from the land.... The
natives were somewhat timid, and it was a long time
before we were able to dispel their fear and induce
them to come and talk to us.... Giving them such
things as looking-glasses, bells, beads, and other trifles,
we enticed a number of them to approach and enter
into friendly relations with us....</p>

<p>“These people go entirely naked and wear not a
particle of clothing. They are of a medium size and
very well proportioned. Their skin is reddish like the
color of a lion’s skin.... They do not allow any
hair to grow on their eyelids and eyebrows, nor on
any part of their bodies; only on their heads, for they
think it very unbecoming. The men and women are
exceedingly quick in their movements, and are unconstrained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
in their deportment. They walk and run
rapidly. The women do not think it a difficult thing
to run a league or two.... These people are excellent
swimmers. The women surpass the men, for we
have observed them many times swimming unaided,
fully two leagues out from land.</p>

<p>“The weapons of these people are bows and
arrows. These are curiously made. They have no
iron or any other hard metal on them. They use
instead the teeth of animals or fish.... They
are expert bowmen, and hit with their arrows whatever
they shoot at. The women in some parts of the
country handle the bow with considerable skill. Their
other weapons are lances and clubs with elaborately
carved heads. When they go to make war their wives
accompany them, not to fight, but to carry provision
on their backs. Sometimes a woman will convey a
burden in this manner thirty or forty leagues, which
the strongest men there cannot do as we have frequently
observed....</p>

<p>“These people, although they appear ignorant as
talkers, are very sagacious and crafty in any matter in
which they are interested. They do not talk much,
and when they do, it is in a low tone.... Their
languages differ so much that we found people living
within the space of a hundred leagues who could not
understand one another’s speech.... They
do not partake of food at appointed times nor in
such quantities to satisfy them during equal intervals.
Whenever their appetites demand food, whether in
the middle of the night or day, it does not matter to
them, they appease their hunger.... They
take their food from earthen basins made by them, or
from gourds cut in half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“They sleep in certain nets made of cotton, very
large, suspended in the air.... These people
are clean and neat in their persons, for they are continually
bathing.... They live together in
common, and make their houses like cottages, which
are very strongly built with the largest trees and covered
with palm leaves.... We found one
which contained six hundred persons, and we saw the
occupants of thirteen houses, who must have numbered
four thousand souls. New sites for these houses are
selected every seven or eight years. When we asked
why they changed the location of their dwellings, they
said it was because the intense heat of the sun caused
painful diseases to spread among them when the
ground about their houses became permeated and foul
with filth; which explanation seemed quite reasonable
to us.</p>

<p>“The riches of these people are the feathers of birds
of different colors, ornaments made of fish bones, and
white and green stones, with which they adorn their
cheeks, lips, and ears.... Some of these people,
when they inter their dead, place water and food at the
head of the corpse.... In some parts of the
country there is a very inhuman custom of disposing
of a person about to die. His relatives carry him into
a great wood, and, fastening one of their sleeping nets
to two trees, put him in it. Having swung him in it
during the day, they, at the approach of night, depart
to their homes, leaving with him water and food sufficient
for his wants during the succeeding five or six
days. Should the ill man partake of the provisions
and recover sufficient strength to enable him to make
his way back to the village, his relatives honor his return
with ceremony....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“For their infirmities they have various kinds of
medicine very different from those we use....
I often observed that when a person was stricken
with fever and grew worse, that they bathed him with
much cold water from head to foot, and then built a
great fire around him, and made him walk about the
inclosed space for an hour or two until he became
quite fatigued, when they allowed him to sleep. Many
were cured by this treatment.... Blood-letting
is an art known to them. They do not take blood from
the arm except in the arm pit. They generally take
it from the loins or the calf of the leg.... They
have no grain seed nor corn, but use instead the root
of a tree, from which they make flour, which is very
good, and which they call <i>Iuca</i>, and another which they
call <i>Cāzabi</i>, and another which they call <i>Ignami</i>. Very
little meat is eaten by them except human flesh....
They devour with fierce avidity their enemies,
whom they kill or capture, whether men or
women. They thought it very strange when they
learned that we did not eat the flesh of our enemies....</p>

<p>“We landed in a port<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> where we found a village
built above the water like Venice. About forty-five
bell-shaped houses were erected here upon very large
piles, and connected one with the other by draw-bridges....
When we were descried by the people they
were seemingly terrified, and to protect themselves
they immediately drew their bridges and shut themselves
up in their houses. While we were observing
them and wondering at their actions, we beheld about
twenty-two canoes (<i>canoe</i>) approaching us from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
direction of the sea. These canoes are boats which
they use, and are made from a single tree. The people
in them rowed toward our boats, no little astonished
at our forms and clothing. As they kept at some
distance from us, we made signs to induce them to
come nearer. Failing to assure them of our peaceful
intentions, and seeing that they would not approach any
nearer, we rowed toward them. But they did not
remain where they were, but rowed to the land, where,
by signs, they intimated that we should wait for a short
time until they returned.</p>

<p>“They hastened away to a mountain, but did not
stay there any length of time. Returning they brought
with them sixteen young girls, and, entering their
canoes, rowed to us, and placed four girls in each of
our boats. We were much surprised at this....
They then kept their canoes alongside of our boats,
and we were led to believe that these people were thus
manifesting their friendship. Not suspecting any thing
different, we observed a great number of people swimming
toward us from the houses. Then some old
women appeared at the doors of the houses shrieking
and pulling their hair as if in great distress. Suspecting
some treachery, we took up our arms. All at once
the girls in our boats plunged into the sea, and the
people in the canoes rowed away, shooting their arrows
at us. Those who swam to us carried lances with
them concealed under the water. Discovering their
treachery, we not only defended ourselves, but vigorously
attacked them. We upset in our boats many of
their canoes and killed many people. In a short time
those who were not hurt left their canoes and swam to
the shore. They had about fifteen or twenty killed
and wounded, and we five slightly wounded....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
We took two girls and two men prisoners. When we
entered their houses we found only two old women and
a sick man. We took from the houses many things of
little value, but did not burn the houses from humane
motives....</p>

<p>“This country is thickly inhabited and contains
a great many rivers. The animals in it are quite
different from those in our country, except the lions,
panthers, stags, hogs, goats, and deer, and some
of these are somewhat different from ours in form....
But how can I describe the birds here, which
are so many and of so many kinds, and the color of
their feathers so different, that the sight of them
amazes one.</p>

<p>“The country is very attractive and fruitful, and
covered with very great woods and forests, in which
the trees are always green, for they never lose their
foliage. There are unnumbered fruits very different
from those in our country. This land lies within the
limits of the torrid zone, below the line describing the
tropic of Cancer, where the pole is elevated twenty-three
degrees above the horizon, at the end of the
second climate.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> ... In this country we made
a baptismal font, and baptized many of the people, who
called us <i>caribi</i>, meaning men of great wisdom.</p>

<p>“The country is called Lariab by the natives. We
sailed along its coast always in sight of land and
ran on the whole course toward the northwest eight
hundred and seventy leagues.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> ... We found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
gold in some places but not much. The discovery
of the country and the knowledge that gold was
in it satisfied us....</p>

<p>“On our return we sailed toward the sea going
between the north and east, and after seven days we
reached some islands.... We landed on one
of them, where we found many people, who called the
island Iti [Hayti?].... We set sail for Spain
with two hundred and twenty-two slave-prisoners,
and arrived at the port of Cadiz on the fifteenth of
October, 1498,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> where we were well received, and
sold our slaves. This is what happened to me in this
my first voyage that may be considered noteworthy.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>“Shortly after the departure of the fleet with
which Vespucci went to the New World, Columbus
complained to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
that the permission given by them in 1495 to those
who desired to go on voyages of discovery toward the
west was prejudicial to the privileges previously
granted him by their Spanish majesties. The latter
therefore revoked their letters-patent of the tenth of
April, 1495, on the second of June, 1497, declaring
that it should “have no force nor effect at any time,
or in any manner whatever, so as to be prejudicial to
the said admiral, and to whatever we have thus granted
and confirmed to him.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“The fitting out of the fleet [for Columbus’s third
voyage to the Indies] was delayed much longer than
was necessary through the negligence and bad management
of the king’s officers, and particularly that
of Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, archdeacon of
Seville. Hence it happened that Don Juan, who was
afterward bishop of Burgos, was, from that time onward,
a bitter enemy to the admiral and his affairs,
and was the chief person among those who brought
him into disgrace with their catholic majesties.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> ...
The admiral made his preparations for the
voyage with all possible diligence, and on the thirtieth
of May, 1498, set sail from the bay of San Lucar de
Berrameda, with six ships, freighted with provisions
and other necessaries for the relief of the planters in
Española and the peopling of that island.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, the fifth of July, Columbus steered
westward from the islands of Cape Verd, and on the
last day of the month altered his course and stood to
the north. “One day about noon as he was thus sailing
[off the coast of Venezuela, South America, north
of the mouths of the Orinoco river], Alonso Perez
Nirando, a sailor of the town of Huelva, while going
up to the round-top, saw the peaks of three mountains
to the westward, distant about fifteen leagues. Not
long afterward they beheld land extending northeastwardly
as far as they could see. When they had
given thanks to God and said the <i>Salve Regina</i> and
other prayers used by seamen in times of distress or
joy, the admiral called the discovered island, la Isla de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Trinidad (the island of the Trinity), for he had thought
of giving this name to the first land they should find
on the voyage, and now God had graciously granted
him the sight of three mountains near together as has
been mentioned. The fleet stood directly west to reach
a point of land on the south side of the island, and then
coasted along that side of it until the anchors were
cast, five leagues beyond the cape, which Columbus
called Punta de la Galera (Point of the Galley), which
name was suggested by a rock on the headland, resembling,
at a distance, a galley under sail. On the
following morning, Wednesday, Columbus continued
his course westward, for there was only one cask of
water on board his ship, and one on each of the other
vessels, and at the last anchorage no convenient place
had been found to obtain more. At the next headland,
which he called Punta de la Playa (Point of the Strand),
the ships anchored and the crews went to a small
brook and obtained a supply of fresh water. No town
or people were seen here, although they had observed
many houses and towns along the coast....
This day, which was the first of August, when the vessels
were sailing between Punta de la Galera and Punta
de la Playa, they discovered the continent, distant
about twenty-five leagues as they guessed. Inasmuch
as they thought it was another island, they called it Isla
Santa (Holy Island).”</p>

<p>When the ships anchored at the southwestern extremity
of the island of Trinidad, which point of land
Columbus called Punta del Arenal, “a large canoe,”
the admiral writes, “came from the eastward, containing
twenty-four men, all in the prime of life, fully armed
with bows, arrows, and shields. As I have said, they were
all young, well proportioned, and not dark black, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
whiter than any other Indians that I had seen....
They wore their hair long and straight, cut in the
Spanish fashion. Their heads were encircled with
cotton scarfs elaborately colored, like the head-dresses
of the Moors. Some wore these scarfs round their
bodies as a covering in the place of breeches. When
I reached Punta del Arenal I found that the island of
Trinidad was separated from the land of Gracia (<i>la
tierra de Gracia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> by a strait two leagues wide....</p>

<p>“I discovered beyond the point which I called
Punta de la Aguda, one of the most attractive countries
in the world, and very densely populated....
Some of the natives immediately came in canoes to
the ship to request me in the name of their king to
come on land. When they saw that I paid no attention
to them, they came in great numbers in their
canoes to the ship, many of them wearing pieces of
gold on their breasts, and some of them bracelets of
pearls on their arms. When I saw these I was exceedingly
pleased, and I made many inquiries to learn
where the people found them. They informed me
that they were obtained in the neighborhood and also
at a place north of the country.... Desiring
to get some pearls like those I had seen, I sent some
men ashore for that purpose.... They related
that when the boats reached the shore, two chiefs,
whom they took for father and son, came to them from
the throng of the people and conducted them to a very
large house, at two springs, not round and tent-shaped
as the other houses. In this house were many seats,
on which they seated our men and themselves. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
then caused bread to be brought with many kinds of
fruit and various wines, both white and red, not made
from grapes but apparently from different fruits....
The men were congregated at one end of the building
and the women at the other. Great vexation was felt
by both parties because they could not understand
each other’s language, for they each desired to ask
questions concerning their respective countries.”</p>

<p>Columbus, describing that part of South America
which he called Gracia, now known as Venezuela, and
also referring to the Orinoco River pouring its flood
of fresh water into the Gulf of Paria, which he called
Golfo de las Perlas (Gulf of Pearls), remarks: “I think
that if the mentioned river does not flow from the
earthly paradise that it comes from a vast extent of
land in the south, of which nothing hitherto has been
known.”</p>

<p>In the letter containing this information respecting
South America the admiral speaks of sending to King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, to whom the letter was
addressed, a map of the country (<i>la pintura de la
tierra</i>).<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The channel between the island of Trinidad and the
land of Gracia (which the natives called Paria), Columbus
called la Boca de la Sierpe (the mouth of the Serpent).
The fleet then sailed from the Gulf of Paria
through its northern outlet, which Columbus called la
Boca del Drago (the mouth of the Dragon), and passed
by the cape which he called Cabo de las Conchas and
the island which he named Margarita. “Although,” as
Ferdinand Columbus remarks, “the admiral saw that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
the country of Paria extended much farther westward,
nevertheless he says that from that time forward he
could not give as good a description of it as he wished
on account of his eyes being too much inflamed by
constant watching. Therefore he was compelled to
obtain the most of his information concerning it from
the sailors and pilots.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>When Columbus arrived, at the end of August, at
the island of Española, where he intended to recruit
his failing health, he found the colonists rebelling
against the authority of his brother Bartolomé, whom
he had left there as adelantado, or lieutenant-governor,
when he sailed for Spain in 1496. Columbus
at once took steps to put an end to the sedition.
Meanwhile complaints were sent to their Spanish majesties,
King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who, to
adjust the differences existing between the two contending
factions, sent Francisco de Bobadilla to Española
to discover the cause of the insurrection and to
punish by fine and imprisonment those whom he should
find culpable. Summoning the admiral to appear
before him at San Domingo, he, as soon as Columbus
arrived, ordered him to be put in irons and to be confined
in the fortress. Having drawn up certain charges
against Columbus, he sent him in chains to Spain.
About the middle of November, 1500, the vessel
arrived at Cadiz. When the news of Columbus’s humiliation
at the hands of Bobadilla became known, the
people everywhere censured the latter for the unwarranted
abasement of the distinguished discoverer. The
king and queen immediately sent orders for Columbus
to be set at liberty, and afterward received him with
many gracious acknowledgments of his important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
services, and publicly declared that Bobadilla should
account to them for his ill treatment.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>When the information contained in Columbus’s
letter respecting the large and valuable pearls possessed
by the people of Paria became known in Spain a number
of capitalists immediately fitted out a fleet to go to
the Land of Pearls. The command of the vessels was
given to Alonso de Hojeda, who had accompanied
Columbus on his second voyage. The cosmographer,
Juan de la Cosa, and Amerigo Vespucci went with
Hojeda. Vespucci, in his account of the voyage, says:
“We departed from the port of Cadiz, three ships in
company, on the sixteenth day of May, 1499....
In forty-four days we arrived at a new land, which we
judged to be main-land, and the continuation of that
previously mentioned. It lay in the torrid zone south
of the equator, where the south pole is elevated five
degrees.” They sailed from their first place of anchorage
and ran southeastwardly along the coast forty
leagues. The strong currents running from the southeast
to the northwest hindered the progress of the
vessels so much that the explorers determined to
change their course and to sail to the northwest. Following
the trend of the coast in this direction, they,
after sailing some time, reached a beautiful bay, at the
entrance of which was a large island. About eighty
leagues beyond this harbor they entered another,
where they went on land and obtained one hundred
and fifty pearls and some gold from the friendly natives.
At another place the inhabitants of the country “had
their cheeks stuffed with a green herb which they were
continually chewing as animals chew their cud, so that
they were scarcely able to speak. Hanging from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
neck of each native were two dried gourd-shells, one
filled with the herb which the people had in their
mouths, the other containing a white meal like chalk
dust. The natives carried small sticks which they
wetted at intervals in their mouths and then put them
into the meal and then into the gourds containing the
herb.” Then they again filled their cheeks with the
herb.</p>

<p>At another place the explorers remained forty-seven
days, where they obtained “one hundred and
nineteen marks of pearls” in exchange for some
small trifles. From a native, Vespucci obtained an
oyster containing one hundred and thirty pearls. The
fleet sailed along the coast to where it was “fifteen
degrees north of the equator.” Thence the explorers
steered for Española to obtain provisions. Departing
from the island on the twenty-second of July, 1500,
they sailed for Spain, and arrived at the port of Cadiz
on the eighth of September.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>When King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella heard
that the Portuguese had reached India by sailing
around Africa, they commissioned Columbus to
explore the western coast of Paria, where he conceived
a navigable strait could be found through
which the vessels of Spain might sail to Cathay. Four
caravels composed the fleet with which he sailed
from Cadiz on the ninth of May, 1502. On the fifteenth
of June, the vessels came in sight of one of the Caribbean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
islands called by the natives Mantinino.
Thence they sailed to the island of Dominica, and
thence to Española. Departing, on the fourteenth
of July, from the port of Brazil, on the south side of
the island of Española, Columbus sailed toward the
Bay of Honduras, eastward of which he imagined was
a strait through which he might sail to the Indian
Ocean and reach Cathay. “We came to certain
islands,” says Ferdinand Columbus, who had accompanied
his father to the New World, “where we went
ashore on the largest, called Guanaia, whence those
that make sea-charts took occasion to call all those
islands Guanaia, which are almost twelve leagues from
the continent, near the province now called Honduras,
though the admiral then called it Cabo Casinas.”
While the fleet was anchored in one of the roadsteads
of the group of islands called Guanaia, a large log-boat
crowded with Indians and filled with certain commodities
arrived there. Describing the capture of this
highly valued prize, Ferdinand Columbus remarks:
“Fortune so ordered it that a canoe, as long as a galley
and eight feet wide, all of one tree, and like the other
boats in shape, put in there, loaded with commodities
brought from the country toward the west and bound
for Nueva España.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> In the middle of it was a covering
like an awning, made of palm leaves, resembling those
of the Venetian gondolas, which protected all beneath
it, that neither rain nor sea-water could wet the goods.
Under the awning were the women and children.
Although there were twenty-five men in the canoe,
they had not the courage to defend themselves against
those in our boats who pursued them. The canoe
being taken without any opposition it was brought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the admiral’s caravel.... He commanded that
such articles should be taken as were thought to be
the most desirable and valuable, as quilts, shirts of
cotton without sleeves, curiously made and dyed with
different colors, apron-cloths, and large sheets in which
the Indian women in the canoe wrapped themselves as
the Moorish women, formerly in Granada, were in the
habit of doing. There were also long wooden swords,
with grooved edges on each side, in which sharp pieces
of flint were compactly fastened with thread and a
bituminous substance, and these cut naked men as
if they were made of steel; also copper hatchets to cut
wood, like those of stone which the other Indians use;
also bells of the same metal, and dishes and crucibles
to melt it in. For food they had such roots and grain
as the people of Española eat, and a kind of liquor
made of maize, like the English beer, and an abundance
of cacao-nuts, which in New Spain pass for
money, which they seemed to value very much, for
when they were brought aboard among the other
goods, I observed that when any of these nuts fell, the
Indians all stooped to pick them up, as if they were
things of value.... Notwithstanding the admiral
had heard so much from those in the canoe concerning
the great wealth, politeness, and ingenuity of the people
westward toward New Spain, yet thinking that he
could sail to those countries lying to the leeward, when
he thought fit from Cuba, he would not go that way at
this time, but adhered to his intention of discovering
a strait in the continent to pass into the South Sea,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
by which he could sail to the countries that produce
spice. Therefore he resolved to sail eastward toward
Veragua and Nombre de Dios, where he imagined the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
strait to be.... He was deceived in the undertaking,
for he did not conceive it to be an isthmus, or
a narrow neck of land, as it really was, but a small bay
extending from sea to sea.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>On the coast of Veragua, now the isthmus of
Panama or Darien, Columbus found the ruins of an
immense building covered with tables of strange hieroglyphics
and unique reliefs. These vestiges of an ancient
civilization made so profound an impression on
the mind of the admiral that he selected a curiously
elaborated piece of the wall, and brought it away in
one of his caravels. “This was the first place, in the
Indies,” says Ferdinand Columbus, “where they saw any
sign of an edifice. It was a great mass of wall of imagery
seemingly composed of lime and stone. The admiral
ordered a piece of it to be brought away to show
the evidence of its antiquity.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>On the fifth of January, 1503, they cast anchor near
a river which the Indians called Yebra, and the admiral
Belem or Bethlem. Westward of it was a river
which the natives called Veragua. Columbus, having
determined to build a town at this point, began, about
the end of February, to erect “houses upon the river
of Belem, about a cannon-shot from its mouth, within a
trench, on the right bank of the river, at the mouth
of which there is a little hill. Besides these houses,
which were all of timber and covered with the leaves of
palm trees growing along the shore, another large
house was built to serve as a store-house and magazine,
in which were stored several cannon, some powder,
provisions, and other necessaries for the use of the
planters....</p>

<p>“The customs of the Indians here are somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
similar to those of the natives of Española and the
neighboring islands; but the people of Veragua and
its neighborhood, when they talk to one another and
eat turn their backs, and are always chewing an herb,
which, as we think,” says Ferdinand Columbus, “makes
their teeth to decay and rot. Their food is fish; these
they take with nets and hooks.... They have
an abundance of maize, which is a kind of grain growing
in an ear, or hard head like millet, of which they
make white and red wine, as beer is made in England,
and mix their spice with it as pleases their palates. It
has a pleasant taste like a sharp, lively wine.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>“In Cariay and the adjacent country,” says Columbus,
“there are great enchanters of a very dreadful
kind.... I saw there, built on a mountain, a
sepulcher as large as a house and elaborately sculptured.
The body lay uncovered with the face downward.
The people told me of other very excellent
works of art.... They said that there were
great mines of copper in the country, of which metal
they make hatchets and other manufactured articles,
both cast and soldered. They also make forges from
it, and all the apparatus of goldsmiths, and also crucibles.
The inhabitants wear clothes. I saw in that
province large sheets of cotton elaborately and skillfully
made, and others very delicately colored with
pencils. They informed me that in the interior,
towards Cathay, that the people there have them interwoven
with gold.... One thing I dare declare,
for there are many to attest it, that in the land of Veragua
I saw more indications of gold in the two first
days [of my stay there] than I had found during four
years in Española.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The Spaniards, however, were soon attacked by the
natives, and were in such distressing circumstances
that Columbus was compelled to abandon his purpose
of leaving a colony on this part of the continent and to
take his men on board the ships and to return to Española.
Speaking of the return-voyage, Ferdinand
Columbus writes: “Thus rejoicing that we were all
together again, we sailed along the coast eastward.
Although all the pilots were of the opinion that we
might return to San Domingo by standing away to
the north, nevertheless the admiral and his brother
knew that it was requisite to run a considerable distance
along this coast before they steered across the
gulf that is between the continent and Española, at
which our men were displeased, thinking that the admiral
designed to sail directly for Spain, whereas he
neither had provisions nor were his ships fit for the
voyage.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But as he knew best what was to be done,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
we held on our course until we came to Porto Bello,
where we were obliged to leave the ship Biscaina, on
account of its leaky condition, being all worm-eaten
through and through. Steering along the coast, we
passed by the port we called Retrete, and a country
near which there were many small islands, which the
admiral called Las Barbas, but the Indians and pilots
call that the territory of the cacique Pocorosa. We
held on this course ten more leagues to the last land
we saw of the continent, called Marmora, and on Monday,
the first of May, 1503, we stood to the north....
Although all the pilots said we should be
east of the Caribbee islands, yet the admiral feared we
should not make Española, which proved to be true....
We reached an Indian town on the coast of
Cuba, called Mataia, where, having obtained some refreshment,
we sailed for Jamaica.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>On his return to the island of Jamaica, in June,
1503, Columbus, describing his voyage along the
isthmus of Darien, wrote to King Ferdinand and
Queen Isabella, saying: “On the thirteenth of May
I reached the province of Mango, which is contiguous
to that of Cathay, and thence I steered for the island of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Española.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Peter Martyr<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> also seems to have held
the opinion that Columbus’s explorations were along the
continent of Asia. Writing in 1510, the first decade
of the New World, he remarks: “The opinion of
Christopher Columbus respecting the magnitude of the
sphere and the opinions of the ancients concerning the
under-navigation of the world seem to be adverse.
Nevertheless the parrots and many other things
brought from there indicate that the islands savor only
of India, either being near it or else of the same nature.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>With this fourth voyage, the zealous and enthusiastic
navigator ended his life-work. On the
twelfth of September, 1504, Columbus for the last time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
set sail from the attractive field of his numerous explorations
and arrived at San Lucar, on the seventh of
November, broken down in health, aged, and the victim
of many unjust accusations and bitter disappointments.
Two years afterward, on the twentieth of May,
1506, he died at Valladolid, being about seventy years
old, leaving to another the discovery, by the way of the
west, of a navigable route to the remote coast of
Cathay.</p>

<p>As intended by him, when he set sail on his first
voyage, Columbus afterward made a map on which
he delineated “all the sea and the lands of the ocean-sea”
(<i>del mar Océanus</i>) discovered by him.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Although
the admiral’s chart is lost, there are several maps extant,
which, in part, represent the islands of Juana,
Jamaica, Española, and the smaller ones, as he evidently
had outlined them on his new sailing chart (<i>carta
nueva de navegar</i>). A map of the world, in the Estense
library, at Modena, made between the years 1501 and
1504,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and the map of the New World (<i>tabula terre
nove</i>), in the edition of Ptolemy’s geography, printed
in 1513, at Strasburg,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> exhibit the islands, discovered
by Columbus on his first voyage, and of which he
speaks in his journal of 1492 and 1493. The high
latitudes in which he placed the Rio de Mares and
other rivers of Juana, when he made his discoveries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
“toward the north,” are designated on these maps.
On the Ptolemy map the name <i>c doffun de abril</i> at the
southeast point of Cuba appears to designate the same
cape as that of <i>c de fvndabril</i> on the map of the world
made by Johann Ruysch, the German cartographer, contained
in the edition of Ptolemy’s geography, printed
at Rome in 1508.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Both of these misspelled names
are evidently anomalous forms of the Spanish designation,
<i>C. de Fuenterabia</i>. The names on Ruysch’s
representation of the island of Cuba correspond more
closely to the Spanish orthography of the designations
given by Columbus to the places he visited than those
which are inscribed on the two maps previously
mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The earliest map extant representing the territory
discovered in the western hemisphere is a map of the
world drafted by the Spanish cartographer, Juan de la
Cosa.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It was found by Baron de Walckenaër in the
possession of a dealer in old books and wares, from
whom he bought it for a small sum of money. Baron
von Humboldt shortly afterward made its discovery
known in his notable work on the geography of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
new continent.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> When the library of Baron de Walckenaër
was sold, in Paris, in 1853, La Cosa’s map was
purchased for the queen of Spain for four thousand
and twenty francs. It is now in the Naval museum,
in Madrid.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The famous map-maker drafted the whole
world, as then known, on an ox-hide, five feet nine
inches long by three feet wide, on a scale of fifteen
Spanish leagues to a degree. The map is attractively
colored and brightened with gold. It may rightly be
called the geographical frontispiece of the history of
the discovery of America.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The map bears the inscription “<i>Juan de la cosa la
fizo enel puerto de S: mjᵃ en año de. 1500.</i>”—Juan de
la Cosa made it in the port of Santa Maria in the year
1500. A picture of St. Christopher bearing the Christ-child
across the water ornaments the space above the inscription.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Most prominent of the islands of the “Mar
Oceanus” delineated on the map are Cuba, Habacoa,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
and La Española. The coast of South America, as far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
as it had been explored, is well represented by the painstaking
map-maker.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>La Cosa, having seen a copy of the map made by
Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot), to display the fields of
the English discoveries of 1497 and 1498, attempted
to show in what part of the New World they were.
As outlined by him, the land explored by Cabot
trends eastwardly from the sea discovered for the
English (<i>mar descubierta por inglese</i>), to the Cape of
England (Cavo de Inglaterra). As La Cosa had
nothing else than his imagination to guide him in delineating
the coast of North America between the field
of the English discoveries and South America, his extension
of the main-land from the one to the other has
no geographical significance. Unable to determine
definitely the position and extent of the territory of the
New World, La Cosa projected it as accurately as his
information respecting the explored parts of its sinuous
coast gave him knowledge. Ignorant of the limits of
the New Land he honorably darkens that part which
might be deemed its cartographic development with
several shades of meaningless colors.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The notable part which England took in searching
for a navigable passage to Cathay, by exploring the sea
toward the west, was incited by the success attending
the explorations of Columbus in the New World. For
it is said that when the news reached England that the
Genoese seaman had discovered the coasts of India
there was great talk in the court of King Henry VII.,
and that men declared with much admiration that it
was more divine than human to sail toward the west
to go to the East where spices grow<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. The bold projector,
who obtained for England the distinguished
honor of being the second European power to enter
the western hemisphere with her ships, was Giovanni
Caboto (John Caboto), a Venetian<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, who had lived a
number of years in London. With confessed confidence
he explained to King Henry and his learned
counsellors the grounds of his belief that the eastern
coast of Asia could be reached by sailing in a direct
westward course from England, and how this course
would be a shorter way than the one taken by Columbus.
He proposed to undertake the voyage at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
own expense should the king grant him the necessary
license.</p>

<p>These overtures of Caboto appear to have been
made about the beginning of the year 1496. Ruy
Gonzales de Puebla, the Spanish ambassador, residing
in England, having learned what Caboto had proposed
to King Henry, at once communicated the information
to their majesties, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
of Spain. Their royal highnesses, in a letter to their
representative at the English court, dated at Tortosa,
the twenty-eighth of March, 1496, thus refer to what
he had written them:</p>

<p>“You say that a person like Colon has come there
to place before the king of England another undertaking
similar to that of the Indies, without prejudice
to Spain or Portugal. If in this way he helps him, he
will be as free to go to the Indies as we were. We
believe that this undertaking is thrown in the way of
the king of England by the king of France in order
to withdraw him from his other affairs. See that the
king of England be not deceived in this or in a similar
matter. The French will endeavor as best they can
to lead him into such enterprises, inasmuch as they are
very uncertain, and are not easily prosecuted. Likewise
see that those ...<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> he is not able to
undertake this thing without prejudice to us and the
king of Portugal.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>On the fifth of March, 1496, King Henry VII.
complied with Caboto’s request as set forth in the
following petition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“To the kyng our souvereigne lord</p>

<p>“Please it your highnes of your moste noble and
haboundant grace to graunt unto John Cabotto, citezen
of Venes, Lewes, Sebestyan and Sancto his sonneys
your gracious lettres patentes under your grete seale
in due forme to be made according to the tenour hereafter
ensuyng. And they shall during their lyves pray
to god for the prosperous continuance of your moste
noble and royale astate long to enduer.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The letters-patent granted to Giovanni Caboto and
his sons, Lodovico, Sebastiano, and Sanctus, to his and
their heirs and deputies, commissioned them to sail,
with five ships of any burden, under the banners, flags,
and ensigns of England, to all parts, regions and gulfs
of the eastern, the western, and the northern seas, in
order to seek, discover, and explore whatever islands,
countries, regions, or provinces of the heathen and of
the infidels, in whatever part of the world they were
situate, which were then unknown to all Christians.
As set forth in the document, the cost and expense of
the expedition were to be defrayed by Caboto and his
sons.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>With this commission Giovanni Caboto set sail
from the port of Bristol, in the spring of 1497, with two
ships, one of which was named the Matthew.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Sailing
westward from England he reached a land which he
believed to be that of Cathay, where he planted the
flag of England and that of Venice. Having explored
the coast of the country for three hundred leagues, he
returned to England, where the news of his discoveries
was enthusiastically received by the interested people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>A brief description of this voyage is contained in a
a letter written by Lorenzo Pasqualigo, in London, on
the twenty-third of August, 1497, to his brothers,
Alvise and Francesco, residing in Venice:</p>

<p>“The Venetian, our countryman, who went with a
ship from Bristol to search for a new island, is returned,
and says that seven hundred leagues from here
he discovered firm land (<i>Terra ferma</i>), the territory of
the Grand Khan. He coasted for three hundred
leagues and landed; saw no human beings, but he has
brought here to the king certain snares which had
been set to catch game, and a needle for making nets;
he also found some felled trees, by which he judged
there were inhabitants. He returned to his ship in
doubt, and he was three months on the voyage, and on
his return saw two islands to starboard, but would not
land, time being precious, as he was short of provisions.
This has greatly pleased the king. He [Caboto] says
that the tides are slack there and do not flow as they
do here.</p>

<p>“The king has promised him, in the spring, ten
ships, armed to his order, and at his request has conceded
him all the prisoners, except those confined for
high treason, to man his fleet. The king has also
given him money with which he may amuse himself
until that time, and he is now in Bristol with his sons
and his wife, who is also a Venetian.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> His name is
Juam Talbot and he is called the great admiral.
Great honor is paid him; he dresses in silk, and
these English run after him like insane people, so
that he can enlist as many of them as he pleases,
and a number of our own rogues besides.</p>

<p>“The discoverer of these places planted on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
newly found land a large cross, with one flag of England
and another of Saint Mark, on account of his
being a Venetian, so that our banner has floated very
far afield.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Raimondo di Soncino, the minister of the duke
of Milan, at the court of England, in a letter, written
on the twenty-fourth of August, 1497, also speaks of
the return of Caboto, saying that he “found two very
large and fertile islands, having likewise discovered
the Seven Cities, four hundred leagues from England,
on the western passage. This next spring his majesty
intends to send him with fifteen or twenty ships.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The discovery of the two islands mentioned by Soncino
is spoken of in two inscriptions placed on a large
map of the world, preserved in the National library in
Paris. The Spanish inscription reads: “This land
was discovered by Ioan Caboto, a Venetian, and by
Sebastian Caboto, his son, in the year of the birth of
our Saviour, Jesus Christ, <span class="allsmcap">M.CCCC.</span> xciiii [<span class="allsmcap">M.CCCC.</span> xcvii?],
on the twenty-fourth of June, in the morning, to which
they gave the name, Prima tierra vista (First land
seen), and to a large island, which is by the said land,
they gave the name of Sant Joan (Saint John), because
it was discovered the same day.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="map3">
<a href="images/map3-full.jpg"><img src="images/map3.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">A copy of a part of a map of the world in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris, known as the Cabot map of 1544. (The original is about
one-third larger than this copy.)</p>
</div>

<p>The map, on the margin of which this inscription
appears, seems to be a copy of one made by Sebastiano
Caboto, in 1544, if the following statement of another
Spanish inscription placed on the chart be true: “Sebastian
Caboto, captain and chief pilot of his sacred
christian catholic majesty, the emperor, Charles V. of
that name, and king, our sovereign, made this large
planisphere, in the year of the birth of our Saviour,
Jesus Christ, 1544, drawn with degrees of latitude and
longitude, and with winds like a marine chart, copying
in part the maps of Ptolemy, and in part those of the
modern discoverers, Spaniards as well as Portuguese,
and in part those made by his father and by him.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>As will be seen on the map, the inscription <i>Prima
tierra uista</i> is placed opposite the tract of land on the
forty-eighth parallel of north latitude, now known as
Cape Breton Island. Evidently to obviate a misconception
respecting the situation of the land first described,
the words <i>prima uista</i> (first seen) are inscribed
on the peninsula to which the former inscription directs
the eye. On this map also is seen a large island,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
lying northwest of the land of Prima Vista, bearing the
name, Yᵃ de S. Juan (Island of St. John).</p>

<p>In a letter written in London, on the eighteenth of
December, 1497, by Raimondo di Soncino to the duke
of Milan, a very interesting account is given of Caboto’s
explorations in the western hemisphere: “Perhaps,
your excellency in the press of so much business will
not be disturbed to learn that his majesty [King
Henry VII.] has gained a part of Asia without a
stroke of the sword. In this kingdom is a popular
Venetian called Messer Joanne Caboto, a man of considerable
ability, most skillful in navigation, who having
seen the most serene kings, first him of Portugal, then
him of Spain, that they had occupied unknown islands,
thought to make a similar acquisition for his majesty
[the king of England]. And having obtained the
royal privileges which gave him the use of the land
found by him, provided the right of possession was reserved
to the crown, he departed in a little ship, from
the port of Bristol, in the western part of this kingdom,
with eighteen persons who placed their fortunes with
him. Passing Ibernia [Ireland] more to the west and
then ascending toward the north, he began to navigate
the eastern part of the ocean. Leaving (for some
days) the north to the right hand, and having wandered
enough he came at last to firm land (<i>terra
ferma</i>) where he planted the royal banner, took possession
for his highness, made certain marks and
returned.</p>

<p>“The said Messer Joanne, as he is a foreigner and
poor, would not be believed, if his partners, who are
all Englishmen and from Bristol, did not testify to the
truth of what he tells. This Messer Joanne has the
representation of the world on a map (<i>in una carta</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and also on a globe (<i>in una sphera solida</i>), which he
has made, and he shows by them where he arrived,
and going toward the East, has passed much of the
country of Tanais.</p>

<p>“And they say that the land is fertile and temperate,
and think that red-wood (<i>el brasilio</i>) grows there, and
the silks, and they affirm that there the sea is full of
fish that can be taken not only with nets, but with fishing-baskets,
a stone being placed in the basket to sink
it in the water, and this, I have said, is told by the said
Messer Joanne.</p>

<p>“And the said Englishmen, his partners, say that
that they can bring so many fish that this kingdom
will have no more business with Islanda (Iceland), and
that from that country there will be a very great trade in
the fish which they call stock-fish (<i>stochfissi</i>). But Messer
Joanne has his thoughts directed to a greater undertaking,
for he thinks of going, after this place is occupied,
along the coast farther toward the East until
he is opposite the island called Cipango, situate in the
equinoctial region, where he believes all the spices
of the world grow, and where there are also gems.
And he says that he was once at Mecca, where from
remote countries spices are carried by caravans, and
that those carrying them being asked where those
spices grew, said they did not know, but that they
came with other merchandise from remote countries to
their home by other caravans, and that the same information
was repeated by those who brought the spices
in turn to them. And he argues that if the oriental
people tell to those of the south that these things are
brought from places remote from them, and thus from
hand to hand, presupposing the rotundity of the earth,
it follows that the last carry to the northern, toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the west. And he tells this in a way that makes it
quite plain to me and I believe it. And what is a
greater thing, his majesty, who is learned and not
prodigal, places confidence in what he says, and since
his return, provides well for him, as this Messer Joanne
tells me.</p>

<p>“And in the spring he says that his majesty will arm
some ships and will give him all the criminals so that
he may go to this country and plant a colony there.
And in this way he hopes to make London a greater
place for spices than Alexandria. And the principals
of the business are citizens of Bristol, great mariners
that now know where to go. They say that the voyage
will not take more than fifteen days, if fortune
favors them after leaving Ibernia. I have talked with a
Burgundian, a companion of Messer Joanne, who affirms
the same, and who is willing to go, since the admiral
(<i>almirante</i>), as Messer Joanne is already styled,
has given him an island, and has also given another to
his barber, a Genoese, and they regard the two as
counts, and my lord, the admiral, the chief. And I believe
that some poor Italian friars will go on the voyage,
who have the promise of being bishops. And I,
being a friend of the admiral, if I wished to go, could
have an archbishopric.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>In order to secure the king’s permission to go on
the proposed voyage, Giovanni Caboto again addressed
a petition to King Henry VII., requesting his majesty
to grant him letters-patent to fit out six ships, in any
of the ports of England, and “theym convey and lede
to the Londe [land] and Isles of late founde” by him.
The request was granted, and the king, on the third
day of February, 1498, in the thirteenth year of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
reign,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> licensed him to take six ships as he desired, and
“all suche maisters,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> maryners, pages, and subjects” as
would willingly “goo and pass with hym in the same
shippes to the seid Londe or Iles.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Having obtained his letters-patent, Giovanni Caboto,
in a short time, had five ships manned and provisioned
for one year. Early in the summer of 1498
he set sail to return to the field of his first explorations.
Pedro de Ayala,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> in a letter dated London, July 25,
1498, addressed to their Spanish majesties, King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella, writes as follows concerning
Caboto’s second voyage: “I think your highnesses have
already heard that the king of England has equipped
a fleet in order to discover certain islands and firm
land (<i>tierra firme</i>), which they have told were discovered
by certain persons of Bristol, who fitted out some
ships during the past year for the same purpose. I
have seen the map which the discoverer has made,
who is another Genoese like Colon, and who has been
in Seville and in Lisbon soliciting aid for this undertaking.
The people of Bristol have, for the last seven
years, sent every year two, three, or four caravels to
search for the island of Brazil [Red-wood], and the
Seven Cities, according to the fancy of this Genoese.
The king determined to send the fleet, because in the
past year they brought certain news of having found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
land. The fleet consists of five ships that carried provision
for one year. The news has come that the
vessel in which Friar Buil<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> went has returned to Ireland
in great distress, the ship being leaky. The Genoese
has continued his voyage. I have seen the course
he steered and the extent of it, and I think that what
they have found or what they are in search of, is what
your highnesses already possess, for it is the cape
which was given to your highnesses by the convention
with Portugal. It is expected that they will return
toward September. I write this because the king of
England has spoken to me on the subject, and he
thinks that your highnesses will be greatly interested
in it. I think the land is not farther distant than four
hundred leagues. I told him that in my opinion the
land was already in the possession of your highnesses,
and though I gave my reasons he did not like them.
I believe that your highnesses are already informed of
this matter, and I do not now send the chart or map of
the world which that man has made, for in my opinion
it is false, since it makes it appear as if the land in
question were not the said islands.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The history of Giovanni Caboto terminates with
the information contained in Pedro de Ayala’s letter.
Nothing definite is known respecting his death.</p>

<p>From the ambiguous and contradictory information
furnished by contemporaneous writers concerning the
voyages of Sebastiano Caboto, it appears that he sailed
to the New Land, either in the years 1497 and 1498,
with his father—or in 1499, in command of a fleet of
vessels fitted out in the port of Bristol, England. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
it is said that, in the fourteenth year of King Henry’s
reign,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Sebastiano Caboto set sail on a voyage to an
island where he knew he could obtain many things of
value: “This year one Sebastian Gabato a genoas
sonne borne in <i>Bristow</i> professing himselfe to be
experte in knowledge of the circute of the worlde
and Ilandes of the same as by his Charts and other
reasonable demonstrations he shewed, caused the
king to man and victual a shippe at <i>Bristow</i> to
search for an Ilande whiche he knewe to be replenished
with rich commodities: in the ship diverse
merchauntes of <i>London</i> adventured smal stockes,
and in the company of this shippe, sayled out of
<i>Bristow</i> three or foure smal shippes fraught with
slight and grosse wares as course cloth, caps, laces,
points.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Peter Martyr, speaking of the voyage, says: “He
fitted out two ships in England at his own expense,
and with three hundred men steered toward the north,
until, in July, he found vast icebergs floating in the
sea and almost perpetual daylight, though on the land
the snow and ice had melted. Therefore he was compelled
to turn the sails, as he says, and to go toward
the west, and yet he held to the south, the shore bending,
that he almost reached the degree of the latitude
of the strait of Hercules, and proceeded so far to the
west that he may have had the island of Cuba on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
left hand, being almost to its degree of longitude.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Steering along this coast, which he called Bacallaos,
he found, as he says, the currents of the sea running
toward the west, but gently, as those found by the
Spaniards navigating in the southern waters. It is
not only likely to be true, but it may be accepted as a
fact, that between these regions [Bacallaos and the
West Indies] there is a great space still unexplored
that offers a way [to the East], where the water flows
from east to west. These currents, I think, are made
to flow round the earth by the impulsion of the heavens,
and are not thrown up and swallowed again by Demorgorgon
breathing.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Perhaps, they may be caused,
as it is said, by influx and reflux.</p>

<p>“Cabotto himself called these regions Baccallaos
(<i>Baccallaos Cabottus ipse terras illas appellavit</i>), because
in the sea there he found great shoals of certain large
fish resembling tunnies, which name was given them by
the natives.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> These fish were so numerous that sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
they retarded the progress of his ships. He
found the people of these regions covered only with
skins, but the natives were not wholly destitute of
reason. He also relates that in these regions there is
a great number of bears which eat fish. They plunge
into the water where they see a shoal of fish and fasten
their claws between the scales of the fish, and in this
way convey them to the shore, where they devour
them. The hunger of the bears being appeased,
they do not annoy men. He declares further that in
many places he saw copper (<i>orichalcum</i>) among the
natives.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Gomara, the Spanish historian, says: “But he who
made this land more widely known was Sebastian
Gaboto, a Venetian.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> He equipped two ships in England
(he having been taken there when he was little),
(<i>do tratava desde pequeño</i>,) at the cost of King Henry
VII., who desired the trade in spices the same as the
king of Portugal. Others say at his own expense,
and that he promised King Henry to go by the north
to Cathay, and to bring spices there in less time than
the Portuguese from the south. He also went to see
if there was any land in the Indies on which a colony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
might be settled. He took three hundred men and
steered a course by the way of Iceland, above the
cape of Labrador, going as far as fifty-eight degrees,
though he says much farther, stating that in the month
of July it was so extremely cold and that there were so
many icebergs floating in the sea, that he did not dare
to go farther.... So Caboto, having inspected
the cold and strange country, changed his course to
the west, and returning again to the Baccalaos (<i>los
Baccalaos</i>), he followed the coast as far as thirty-eight
degrees, and then returned to England.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Galvano, the Portuguese historian, says that when
Sebastiano Caboto returned from the north, he diminished
“the altitude till he came to thirty-eight degrees,
and from there returned to England. Others will have
it that he went as far as the point of Florida, which is
in twenty-five degrees.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>In the discourse of Sir Humphrey Gilbert respecting
“a new passage to Cataia,” it is said: “Furthermore,
Sebastian Cabota by his personall experience,
and trauell, hath set foorth, and described this passage,
in his Charts, whiche are yet to be seene in the
Queenes Maiesties priuie Gallerie, at Whitehall, who
was sent to make this discoverie by King Henrie the
seauenth, and entered the same fret: affirming, that he
sailed very far westward, with a quater of the North,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
on the north side of Terra de Labrador<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> the eleuenth
of June, vntil he came to the septentrional latitude
of 67½ degrees and finding the seas still open
said that he might, and would have gone to Cataia, if
the mutinie of the Maister and Mariners had not ben.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>It is further related that in the eighteenth year of
the reign of King Henry VII.,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> three Indians were
brought to England from the islands discovered by
Sebastiano Caboto: “Thys yeare, were brought vnto
the Kyng three men taken in the new founde Ilands,
by Sebastian Gabato, before named in Anno 1468,
these men were clothed in Beastes skinnes, and eate
raw Flesh, but spake such a language as no man could
vnderstand them, of the which three men, two of them
were seene in the Kings Court at Westminster two
yeares after, clothed, like Englishmen, and could not
bee discerned from Englishmen.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The field of the discoveries of Giovanni Caboto,
represented on the map made by Juan de la Cosa, in
1500, and on the one of 1544, in the National library, in
Paris, was apparently the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton
Island<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and of Nova Scotia. The part of the peninsula
designated Prima Vista, (First Seen,) on the map
of 1544, appears to be the same as that which on La
Cosa’s chart is denominated Cavo de Inglaterra (Cape
of England). The coast, from Cape Breton southwestward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
to the Bay of Fundy, the sea discovered for the
English (<i>mar descubierta por inglese</i>),<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> is delineated by
La Cosa with approximate accuracy.</p>

<p>The information given by Peter Martyr, Gomara,
and Galvano respecting the voyage of Sebastiano Caboto,
makes the fact evident that the latter sailed northwestwardly
along the coast of Labrador almost to the
sixtieth parallel, where he was so far to the west
“that he had the island of Cuba on his left hand” and
had nearly reached the longitude of the island. On
his return, after running along the coast of Baccallaos,
he sailed southward, but too far east of the mainland
to see its coast, and reached the latitude of the thirty-eighth
parallel; whence he steered for England. If
Sebastiano Caboto had explored any part of the present
coast of the United States he certainly would have
imparted some information respecting its physical
features, its inhabitants, its flora and fauna, to the inquisitive
chroniclers of his age. The descriptions of
the regions explored by him only apply to the more
northern parts of the continent, represented on the
map of 1544, to which territory was given the name
La Tierra de los Bacallaos (Land of Codfish).<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> On
the planisphere of 1544, the following statement is inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
concerning the country discovered by Sebastiano
Caboto. “The people wear clothes made of the
skins of animals, use bows and arrows, lances, darts,
knob-headed clubs, and slings in their wars. The
country is very sterile. In it are many white bears,
and deer as large as horses, and many other animals
of the same class; also immense numbers of fish such
as soles, salmon, very large lings, a yard in length, and
many other kinds of fish, but the most numerous are
those called bacallaos. In this country there are falcons
as black as ravens, eagles, partridges, linnets, and
many other birds of different kinds.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>“This much concerning Sebastiano Gabotes discouerie
may suffice for a present cast,” says Hakluyt,
“but shortly, God willing, shall come out in print all
his owne mappes and discourses, drawne and written
by himselfe, which are in the custodie of the worshipfull
master Williā Worthington, one of her Maiesties
Pensioners who (because so worthie monumentes
shoulde not be buried in perpetuall obliuion) is very
willing to suffer them to be ouerseene and published in
as good order as may bee, to the encouragement and

<p>While the Spanish and the English expeditions had
failed to find the attractive shores of Cathay by sailing
westwardly across the Atlantic, the Portuguese were
more fortunate in their long-continued attempts to
reach the dominions of the Grand Khan by sailing
eastwardly. Restricted by the papal decree to the prosecution
of her voyages of discovery on the east side
of the line of demarkation, Portugal zealously persisted
in seeking along the coast of Africa a way to the
Orient. Vasco da Gama, an intrepid navigator, was
placed in command of an expedition, and sailed from
Lisbon, in March, 1497, in the path marked out by
Bartolomeu Dias, in 1487. When Da Gama came to
the Cape of Good Hope, or the Stormy Cape (Cabo
Tormentoso), he realized that the windy headland was
rightly named. The hazardous attempts which he repeatedly
made to pass the stormy promontory so impressed
his sailors with his extreme venturesomeness
that they endeavored to persuade him to turn back.
It is said that this made Da Gama comport “himself
very angrily, swearing that if they did not double the
cape, he would stand out to sea again as many times
until the cape was doubled, or there should happen
whatever should please God.” Having achieved his
bold purpose, on the twenty-second of November,
1497, Da Gama made himself famous in reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
remote coast of India, on the seventeenth of May,
1498, and entered the harbor of Calicut,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> three days
afterward. Returning on the homeward voyage, he
arrived at Lisbon, about the beginning of September,
1499.</p>

<p>To perfect and enjoy the privileges of her inaugurated
commerce with India, Portugal immediately
fitted out a fleet of merchantmen to carry her commodities
to the distant country over the sea-path explored
by her daring navigators. Pedro Alvarez Cabral was
given command of thirteen ships, with which he sailed on
the ninth of March, 1500, with instructions to hold his
course out at sea at some distance from the coast of
Africa, in order to avoid the troublesome currents and
delaying winds which had previously deterred mariners
from encountering the perils of the unexplored route
near the main-land. Cabral proceeded southward, but
near the Cape Verd Islands lost sight of one of his
ships, and while seeking her he lost his course. Fortunately,
on Wednesday afternoon, on the twenty-second
of April, he descried the summit of a round and
high mountain on the eastern coast of Brazil, which he
called Monte Pascoal.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Perceiving the next morning
that he had anchored opposite the mouth of a river,
he sent Nicolao Coelho to examine it. From this anchorage
he sailed in search of a safe harbor, and on
Saturday, the twenty-fifth of April, found the roadstead
which he called Porto Seguro, which was in seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
degrees of south latitude, according to the observation
made there. On the first of May a large wooden cross
was erected to which was affixed the declaration of
Cabral’s discovery of the country for the king of Portugal.
Cabral, having dispatched Gaspar de Lemos with
a small vessel to Lisbon with the report of his discovery,
set sail, on the third of May, for India. Cabral
called the discovered country Terra de Vera Cruz
(Land of the True Cross), which name was shortly
afterward changed to Terra de Santa Cruz (Land
of the Holy Cross), and subsequently Brazil was
substituted for it.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1500 the Portuguese sailed in a different
direction to seek a short route to Cathay. The
Portuguese historian, Galvano refers to the expedition,
saying: “In this same year 1500 it is said that Gaspar
Cortereal<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> begged permission of King Emmanuel to
discover the New Land (Terra Nova). He departed
from the island Terceira with two ships equipped
at his own expense, and he sailed to that region which
is in the north in fifty degrees of latitude, which is a
land now called after his name. He returned home
in safety to the city of Lisbon. Sailing a second
time on this voyage the ship was lost in which he
went, and the other vessel came back to Portugal.
His brother Miguel went to seek him with three
ships at his own cost, and when they came to that
coast, and found so many entrances of rivers and
havens, each ship entered a different river, with this
regulation and command, that they all three should
meet again on the twentieth of August. The other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
two ships did as commanded, and they, seeing that
Miguel Cortereal came not on the appointed day nor
afterward in a certain time, returned to this realm and
never heard any thing more concerning him....
But that country is called Terra dos Cortereals unto
this day.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Damião de Góes, the Portuguese historian, says
Cortereal called this region Terra Verde (Greenland),
on account of its remarkable verdure, and the vast
forests stretching all along the coast.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Ramusio, speaking of the exploration of the coast
of North America says: “In the part of the New
World, which runs toward the north and northwest,
opposite our habitable part of Europe, many captains
have navigated, and the first (by that which one
knows), was Gaspar Cortereale, a Portuguese, who, in
1500, went with two caravels intending to find some
strait of the sea whence by a shorter voyage than that
taken around Africa he would be able to go to the
Spice Islands. He sailed so far forward that he came
to a place where it was extremely cold, and he found,
in the latitude of sixty degrees, a river closed with
snow, to which he gave the name, calling it Rio
Nevado. But he had not sufficient courage to pass
much beyond it. The whole of this coast, which runs
two hundred leagues from Rio Nevado as far as to the
port of Malvas, in fifty-six degrees, he saw full of
people and along it many dwellings.”<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>The earliest account of Gaspar Cortereal’s voyage
of 1501, from which he never returned, is contained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
a letter written by Pietro Pasqualigo, the Venetian
ambassador at the court of Portugal, to his brothers
in Italy, dated October 19, 1501. The writer says:
“On the eighth of the present month, one of the two
caravels which his most serene majesty sent the past
year under the command of Gaspar Corterat, arrived
here, and reports the finding of a country distant west
and northwest, two thousand miles, heretofore quite
unknown.</p>

<p>“They ran along the coast between six hundred
and seven hundred miles without arriving at its termination,
on which account they concluded it to be the
same continent that is connected with another land
which was discovered last year in the north, but which
the caravel could not reach on account of the ice and
the vast quantity of snow, and they are confirmed in
this belief by the multitude of great rivers they found,
which certainly could not proceed from an island. They
report that this land is thickly peopled, and that the
houses are built of very long beams of timber, and covered
with the skins of fishes. They have brought
hither along with them seven of the inhabitants, including
men, women, and children; and in the other
caravel, which is looked for every hour, they are bringing
fifty more. These people, in color, figure, stature,
and expression, greatly resemble gypsies. They are
clothed with the skins of different beasts, but chiefly of
the otter, wearing the hair outside in summer, and next
to the skin in winter. These skins, too, are not sewed
together, nor shaped to the body in any fashion, but
wrapped around the arms and shoulders as they were
taken from the animals.... On this account
their appearance is wholly barbarous; yet they are
very sensible to shame, gentle in their manners, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
better made in their arms, legs, and shoulders than can
be expressed. Their faces are punctured in the same
manner as the Indians; some have six marks, some
eight, some fewer. They use a language of their own,
but it is understood by no one. Moreover, I believe
that every possible language has been addressed to
them. They have no iron in their country, but manufacture
knives out of certain kinds of stones, with which
they point their arrows.</p>

<p>“They have also brought from this island a piece
of a broken sword inlaid with gold, which we can pronounce
undoubtedly to have been made in Italy; and
one of the children had in his ears two pieces (<i>todini</i>)
of silver, which likewise appear to have been made in
Venice, a circumstance inducing me to believe that
their country belongs to the continent, since it is
evident that if it were an island where any vessel
had touched before this time we should have heard
of it.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>“They have plenty of salmon, herring, cod, and
other fish of the same kind. They have an abundance
of timber, principally pine, fitted for masts and
yards of ships, on which account his serene majesty
anticipates the greatest profit from this country, both
in providing timber for ships, of which he, at present,
stands in great need, and from the men that inhabit it,
who appear admirably fitted to endure labor, and will
probably be the best slaves which have been found up
to this time.</p>

<p>“This arrival appeared to me to be an event
of which it was right to inform you; and if on
the arrival of the other caravel I receive any additional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
information, it shall be transmitted to you in
like manner.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Gaspar Cortereal, who was expected to return to
Lisbon in the second caravel, never reached Portugal.
Miguel, his brother, sailed from Lisbon in May 1502,
with three ships, to search for Gaspar and the missing
vessel, but he was never heard of again, and it was
conjectured that both of the brothers had been slain
by the savages from whom they had taken so many
of their relatives to serve as slaves in Portugal.</p>

<p>No little enthusiasm was created at the court of
Portugal by Cabral’s report of the discovery of the
Land of the True Cross. King Emmanuel at once
ordered three vessels to be equipped to sail to the
new country. Having heard of the voyages made
by Amerigo Vespucci to the Land of Pearls (Terra
delle Perle), he wrote to Vespucci in Seville, and solicited
him to enter his service. The illness of the explorer
did not then permit him to accept the tempting
offer of the king of Portugal. However, when he
was afterward visited by the king’s ambassador, Giuliano
di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, Vespucci consented
to go to Lisbon and to be commissioned by King
Emmanuel to accompany the fleet that was prepared
to sail to Terra de Vera Cruz. His departure from
Spain, he says, was a matter of regret to all who knew
him, because there he was honored, and there the king
had a right to claim his services.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Narrating the incidents
of his third voyage to the New World, Vespucci
writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“We departed from the port of Lisbon, three ships
in company, on the tenth of May, 1501, and took our
course directly for the Grand Canary Islands....
From there we sailed to the coast of Ethiopia, and arrived
at the port called Beseneghe, in the torrid zone....
We left this port of Ethiopia and steered to
the southwest.... In sixty-seven days we
reached land lying seven hundred leagues southwest
of that port.... The season was very unfavorable
for the voyage, particularly when we approached
the equator, where, in the month of June, it is winter....
It pleased God, however, to show us a new
country on the seventeenth of August. Then we
anchored at the distance of a half league from the
coast. We got out our boats and went on land to see
if the country were inhabited, and if it were, by what
class of people. We found that it was inhabited by a
people of a lower condition than that of beasts....
We took possession of it in the name of his
majesty. It lies five degrees south of the equator....
We sailed in a southeasterly direction, on a
line parallel with the coast, making many landings, but
never discovering any natives who could converse
with us. Running on this course, we found the land
made a turn to the southwest. As soon as we doubled
the cape, which we named the Cape of St. Augustine,
we began to sail to the southwest.... This
cape is eight degrees south of the equator.”<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>While the explorers were sailing along the east
coast of Brazil, they arrived at a place where they
anchored five days. “Here,” says Vespucci, “we
found carmine stems very large and green, and some
already dry on the tops of the trees. We left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
this port, always sailing to the southwest in sight
of the land, making many anchorages and treating
with innumerable people. We went so far toward the
south that we were beyond the tropic of Capricorn
where the south pole is elevated thirty-two degrees
above the horizon. We had entirely lost sight of the
Little Bear, and the Great Bear was very low, almost on
the verge of the horizon.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> We steered by the stars of
the south pole, which are many, and much larger and
brighter than those of our pole. I traced the figures
of the greater part of them, particularly those of the
first and greater magnitude, giving an explanation
of the circuits which they made around the pole,
together with a description of their diameters and
semi-diameters, as may be seen in my four journeys.
We ran about seven hundred and fifty leagues along
this coast.... We saw a great number of redwood
(verzino) and cassia trees, and of those which
produce myrrh.... We found ourselves in
such a high southern latitude, that the south pole
was elevated above the horizon fifty-two degrees....
The cold [on the seventh of April, 1502]
was so severe that no one in the fleet could endure
it.... We agreed that the superior captain<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
should make signals for the fleet to turn about,
and that we should depart from this land and steer
our course in the direction of Portugal.”</p>

<p>After touching at the port of Sierra Leone,
and at the Azores, the explorers reached the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
port of Lisbon on the seventh day of September,
1502.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Vespucci was again sent by the king of Portugal,
in 1503, with a fleet of six ships commanded by Gonçalo
Coelho, to discover an island “toward the east
called Melaccha, which we know lies in the sea,” says
Vespucci, “thirty-three degrees from the south pole.”
Departing from the port of Lisbon on the tenth of
May, the vessels stood for the Cape Verd Islands.
After going to Sierra Leone on the coast of Africa,
the fleet sailed toward the southwest. On this course
one of the vessels struck on a rock, and was abandoned
by the crew. On the east coast of Brazil, the
fleet entered the harbor which the Portuguese called
the Bay of All Saints (Bahia de todos os Santos). At
a harbor two hundred and sixty leagues farther south,
or in eighteen degrees south latitude, a fortress was
erected, and garrisoned with twenty-four men. The
fleet then sailed for Portugal, and entered the port of
Lisbon on the eighteenth of June, 1504.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The opinion of Columbus that a strait could be
found to the south or southwest of Cuba through which
ships might sail to Cathay, induced Vicente Yañez Pinzon
and Juan Diaz de Solis in 1506 to search along the
coast bordering the Bay of Honduras for a navigable
passage to the Indian Ocean.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> They held the same
course as the admiral, says Herrera, “and sailing as far
as the islands Guanajos steered westward as far as
Golfo Dulce, but did not see it, for it lies hid. However,
they observed the inlet the sea makes between the
land that forms the bay and the coast of Iucatan....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
From where they descried the Sierras of
Caria, they steered northward and discovered a great
part of the main-land of Iucatan.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The unique and peculiarly shaped map made by the
German cartographer, Johann Ruysch, contained in the
edition of Claudius Ptolemy’s geography, printed at
Rome, in 1508,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> is the earliest engraved chart on which
appear the fields of discovery, in the western hemisphere,
entered by Columbus, Cabot, Cortereal, Cabral,
Vespucci, and other early explorers of the coast of the
new continent.</p>

<p>Geographically ignorant of the longitude of the discovered
part of North America, then called the New
Land (Terra Nova), Ruysch represents it as if it were
a part of the eastern coast of Asia, between the two
hundred and eightieth and the three hundredth meridians.
Better informed respecting its latitude, he delineates
it as extending from the forty-fifth to the fifty-fifth
parallel of north latitude.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Immediately north of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the New Land is the Greenland Sea (Sinus Grvenlantevs),
and beyond it, Greenland (Grvenlant), discovered
by the Northmen. South of the New Land, between
the fortieth and twenty-fifth parallels is the unnamed
and falsely represented island of Cuba, on the west side
of which is a scroll bearing the information: “As far
as this the ships of Ferdinand, king of Spain, have
come.” South of this island and that of Española
(Spagnola) is the discovered part of South America,
then denominated the Land of the Holy Cross or the
New World (Terra Sancti Crucis sive Mundus Novus).
The inscription on the represented territory embraces
the following information: “At different places this
region is inhabited, and it is supposed by many to be
another world. Women and men appear either entirely
naked or clad with interwoven leaves and the feathers
of birds of various colors. They live together in common
without any religion or king. They are continually
at war among themselves. They eat the human
flesh of captives. They exercise so much in the salubrious
air that they live more than one hundred and
fifty years. They are rarely sick, and then they cure
themselves solely with the roots of plants. Here lions
are born, and serpents and other terrible monsters
found in the forests. Very large quantities of pearls and
gold are in the mountains and rivers. From here
Brasil-wood, or verzini, and cassia are carried away by
the Portuguese.” Below this inscription is another
which contains the following statement: “Portuguese
navigators have inspected this part of this land, and
have sailed as far as the fiftieth degree of south latitude
without seeing the southern limit of it.”</p>

<p>On the scroll on the western part of the delineated
territory of South America this information is inscribed:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
“As far as this Spanish navigators have
come, and they have called this land, on account
of its greatness, the New World. Inasmuch as they
have not wholly explored it nor surveyed it farther
than the present termination, it must remain thus imperfectly
delineated until it is known in what direction
it extends.”</p>

<p>On the upper part of the right margin of the map
the following fiction respecting the configuration of the
earth at the north pole is inscribed. “It is said in
the book concerning the fortunate discovery<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> that at
the arctic pole there is a high magnetic rock, thirty-three
German miles in circumference. A surging sea
surrounds this rock, as if the water were discharged
downward from a vase through an opening. Around
it are islands, two of which are inhabited.”</p>

<p>North of Greenland is another inscription containing
a popular fiction of the dangers besetting ships in
the Arctic Ocean: “Here a surging sea begins; here
the compasses of a ship do not hold, nor are ships
which have iron about them able to turn about.”
Among the perils of the Greenland Sea were the deceptions
practised by the savages inhabiting the islands
in it: “It is said that those who came formerly in
ships among these islands for fish and other food were
so deceived by the demons that they could not go on
land without danger.”</p>

<p>The four voyages of Amerigo Vespucci had acquainted
him with so many unknown peoples and
places in the New World that he was induced by his
own inclinations and the suggestions of his friends to
write an account of the explorations of the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
expeditions with which he had been sent by the
sovereigns of Spain and Portugal. In his letter, dated
in Lisbon, the fourth of September, 1504,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> he speaks
of the intended publication of his voyages in a volume
in the style of a geography (<i>un uolume in stilo geografia</i>),
and calls the composition (<i>zibaldone</i>), “Le
Quattro Giornate” (The Four Journeys).</p>

<p>The earliest known work containing an account of
Vespucci’s four voyages is entitled “Cosmographiae
introductio” (Introduction to geography), printed in
St. Dié, in Lorraine, on the twenty-sixth of April,
1507.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> This rare Latin book was the work of a
German scholar named Martin Waldseemüller, a professor
of geography in the gymnasium in St. Dié,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
who having translated his surname into Hylacomylus<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
affixed this Greek pseudonym to his writings. On
the reverse page of the fifteenth leaf of Hylacomylus’s
Introduction to geography is the notable suggestion
that the land in the western hemisphere visited
by Amerigo Vespucci should be called Amerige
or America. The enthusiastic geographer, having
described Europe, Asia, and Africa, remarks:</p>

<p>“And as now these parts have been more widely
surveyed, and another fourth part has been found by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Americus Vesputius (as will be perceived by what follows),
I can not see why any one can justly forbid
the calling of this part Amerige or America, that is,
the land of Americus, from Americus, the discoverer,
an intelligent man, as Europe and Asia have taken
their names from women.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The name America in a short time became a
popular designation for the continent in the western
hemisphere.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>Although Vespucci repeatedly mentions in his
letter that he held subordinate positions under the
superior captains commanding the different fleets with
which he had sailed to the New World, twenty-one
years after his death he was unjustly accused by
Johannes Schoner, in a little geographical work, as
having contrived to have the continent called by his
name.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Schoner’s imputation was evidently caused
by a spirit of ill-will, for he attempted, it would seem,
to lessen the importance of the discoveries made by
Spain and Portugal, by placing on a globe, made
by him in 1520, this inscription designating South
America: “America vel Brasilia sive papagalli terra”
(America or Brasil or the land of parrots).<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Later still
a number of writers in turn undertook to defame Vespucci
by asserting that he did not make the voyage of
1497, and to support their arguments quoted the
erroneous statements of the different versions of his
letter. The assumptions of these writers, however,
are not corroborated by the Italian text of Vespucci’s
letter, in part presented on the preceding pages, nor
are they verified by later researches in the archives of
Spain and Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When the Spaniards were exploring the West India<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
archipelago a report became current that on one of
the more northward islands there was a fountain, the
water of which possessed extraordinary virtues. Peter
Martyr heard the rumor, and wrote, in 1511, to the
bishop of Rome, saying: “There is an island about
three hundred and twenty-five leagues from Española,
as they say who have searched for it, named
Boiuca or Agnaneo, on which is a never-failing
spring of running water of such marvelous efficacy
that when the water is drunk, perhaps, with some
attention to diet, it makes old people young again.
And here I must beg your holiness not to think that
this is said jestingly or thoughtlessly, for they have
reported it everywhere as a fact, so that not only all
the common people but also the educated and the
wealthy believe it to be true.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The island of Boiuca appears to be partly outlined
on the small map in Peter Martyr’s “Legatio Babylonica,”
printed at Seville in 1511. It is designated
on the latter as a part of the island of Beimeni,—“Isla
de beimeni parte.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Among those who gave credence to the fiction of
the marvellous virtues of the spring of Boiuca was Juan
Ponce de Leon, a Spanish cavalier, who had attained
considerable military fame in the West Indies.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> He
had sailed from Spain in 1493 to Española in one of
the ships of Columbus’s second expedition. In 1509 he
took part in the subjugation of the Island of Borriquen,
afterward called Porto Rico, of which he was made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
governor. Beguiling himself with the hope that he
could renew the vigor of his youth by bathing in the
stream of life-giving water, and at the same time add
honor to his name by becoming the discoverer of the
island on which the fountain was said to be, Juan Ponce
fitted out three vessels and sailed from the port of St.
German, Porto Rico, on Thursday, the third of March,
1512, to search for the island Boiuca, which some called
Bimini. “It is certain,” says Herrera, the Spanish historian,
“that Juan Ponce de Leon besides intending to
make new discoveries, as all the Spaniards at that time
aspired to do, was also intent on finding the fountain
of Bimini and a river in Florida; the Indians of Cuba
and Española affirming that old people bathing themselves
in them became young again, and it was a fact
that many Indians of Cuba, firmly believing that there
was such a stream, had found that island not long
before the Spaniards, and had passed over to Florida
in search of the river, and there built a town, where
their descendants reside to this day. This report so
affected all the princes and caciques in those parts that
it was a hobby to find a river which wrought such a
wonderful change as made old people young, so that
there was not a river or a brook, scarcely a lake or a
puddle, in all Florida, in which they did not bathe
themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>The explorations and discoveries of Juan Ponce are
thus described by Herrera: “On Sunday, the
twenty-seventh of March, the day of the Feast of the
Resurrection, commonly called the Feast of Flowers,
(<i>que era Dia de Pascua de Resurreccion, que comunmente
dicen de Flores</i>,) they saw an island and passed by it.
On Monday, the twenty-eighth, they steered in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
same direction, fifteen leagues, until Wednesday, when
the weather became foul. They then stood west-northwest
until the second of April. The water grew
shallower until they came into nine fathoms, a league
from the land, which was in thirty degrees and eight
minutes. Thinking this land was an island they called
it La Florida, because it had a very pretty landscape
of many green groves, and it was level and regular, and
because they discovered it at the time of the Floral
Feast (<i>Pascua Florida</i>).<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Juan Ponce wished the
name to conform to these two facts. He went on land
to learn the language and to take possession.</p>

<p>“On Friday, the eighth, they sailed again the same
way, and on Saturday, south by east, until the twentieth,
when they saw some Indian huts from the place
where they had cast anchor. The next day the three
ships sailed along the coast and entered a current
which was so swift that it drove them back, although
they had the wind strong.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The two ships, near the
land, dropped their anchors, but the force of the stream
was so great that it strained the cables. The third
vessel, a brigantine, being farther out, either found no
bottom or was not sensible of the current, which carried
her so far from the shore that they lost sight of her,
although the day was bright and the weather fine.</p>

<p>“Juan Ponce being called by the Indians went
ashore and the latter at once undertook to possess
themselves of the boat, the oars, and the arms. This
was tolerated till one of the Indians stunning a sailor
with a stroke of a cudgel on the head, when the Spaniards
were compelled to fight. They had two of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
men wounded with darts and arrows pointed with sharp
bones, and the Indians received little injury. Night
parting them, Juan Ponce, with considerable difficulty,
got his men together and sailed thence to a river,
where they wooded and watered, and waited for the
brigantine. Sixty Indians came to attack them, one
of whom was taken to give information and to learn
the Spanish language. The river they called Rio de
la Cruz, (River of the Cross), planting there a stone
cross, bearing an inscription.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>On the twenty-third of September, after having
coasted in different directions along the Flowery Land,
Juan Ponce determined to return to Porto Rico. Before
he set sail, he sent Juan Perez de Ortubia to make
a further search for the rejuvenating fountains on the
island of Bimini. Not long after Juan Ponce’s return
to Porto Rico, Ortubia arrived there and reported that
he had found the island, but not the wonderful spring.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>Juan Ponce de Leon went to Spain and obtained
from the crown the appointment of adelantado of
Bimini and Florida. When he heard, while living at
Porto Rico, the reports of the success of Hernando
Cortes in Mexico, he fitted out, in 1521, two ships, and
sailed to Florida to take possession of it and to settle
a colony on its attractive shores. But the natives valiantly
opposed the occupation of their country and
drove the ambitious invader, with the loss of many
men, to his ships. Juan Ponce was wounded in the
thigh by an arrow. The vessels sailed to Cuba, where
the impoverished and disabled Spaniard not long after
died.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The exploration of Central America was continued
in 1511 by Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, a native of Xeres
de los Caballeros, Spain, who had accompanied Rodrigo
de Bastidas when he sailed on his voyage of discovery
to the New World, in October, 1500. In 1510
the Indian village on the isthmus of Darien, west of
the Gulf of Uraba, was made the seat of the government
of this part of the continent by the Spaniards,
and called Santa Maria de la Antigua del Darien.
Vasco Nuñez de Balboa was appointed alcade of the
new colony. This ambitious and avaricious adventurer
penetrated the dense forest belting the northern
coast of the isthmus, and invaded the interior, where
he found a wealthy cacique, named Comogre. The
Indian chief entertained Vasco Nuñez and his fourscore
followers with generous hospitality in his
large and attractive palace, a wooden building one
hundred and fifty paces long and eighty wide. He
presented his indigent guest with four thousand
ounces of golden ornaments and sixty slaves. “This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
gold, with as much more obtained at another place,”
says Peter Martyr, “our men weighed on the porch of
Comogre’s palace, to separate the fifth part due to the
king’s exchequer, for it was a law that the fifth part of
the gold, pearls, and precious stones should be given
to the royal treasurer, and the remainder be divided
among the discoverers. While our men were wrangling
and contending about the division of the gold, the
eldest son of Comogre, the cacique, who was present
and whom we commended for wisdom, approached
with some appearance of anger him who was weighing
the treasure, and struck the balances with his fist, scattering
the gold all over the porch.” Pointing southward
toward the mountains, he told them that beyond
those <i>sierras</i> was a great sea, on which people sailed
with ships as large as theirs, and that the adjacent
country contained great quantities of gold.</p>

<p>Balboa heard this surprising announcement with
delight, and, ambitious to be honored as the discoverer
of the unnamed sea and the country abounding with
rich mines, began to plan to go there and achieve the
notoriety that would make his name forever famous.
On the first of September, 1513, Vasco Nuñez, with
one hundred and ninety men and a number of Indian
guides, embarked at Santa Maria de la Antigua and
set sail in a brigantine for the Indian village of Coyba.
Here he began his toilsome and dangerous march
across the isthmus. After enduring untold hardships
the pertinacious Spaniard and his small body of wayworn
followers arrived at the foot of the Sierra de
Quarequa, intercepting the view of the unseen ocean.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
While climbing the rugged slope of the intervening
mountain, on the twenty-fifth of September, Balboa
commanded his men to halt and to remain where they
were until he had reached the summit and surveyed
the wide expanse of the great ocean billowing between
the isthmus and the remote shores of India. When
the enthusiastic Spaniard ascended to the top of the
mountain and beheld the Mar del Sur (Sea of the
South), he fell upon his knees and thanked God for
honoring him as its discoverer, “as he was a man of
moderate ability, little knowledge, and humble birth.”
Calling to his men to come to him, he ordered them,
after surveying the discovered sea, to construct a
wooden cross, and to plant it where he had kneeled
and rendered thanks for the honor conferred on him.
A mound of stones was built near the cross as a monument
to commemorate the discovery of the ocean and
the adjacent country for his majesty, the king of Spain.
Descending the southern slope of the mountain, Balboa
and his followers made their way to the shore of the
bay, which he called San Miguel, where the proud
discoverer, with a banner embellished with the picture
of the Holy Virgin and Child and the insignia of Spain,
marched into the sea, and took possession of it in the
name of his sovereign, King Ferdinand. Having explored
a part of the southern coast of the isthmus,
Vasco Nuñez and his men reëntered the wilderness
and arrived at Santa Maria de la Antigua on the nineteenth
of January, 1514.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>In the following year Gaspar Morales and Francisco
Pizarro crossed the isthmus with sixty men, and visited
the island which Balboa had called Isla Rica. In 1516,
Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, ambitious of obtaining greater
fame, and having two hundred men and considerable
money at his command, transported the timber, rigging,
and other appendages of two brigantines across
the isthmus, and after putting the vessels in sailing
condition, launched them upon the recently discovered
ocean. After a short cruise among the islands near
Isla Rica, Balboa returned to the Spanish settlement at
Acla, on the north coast, where he was arrested on
some false charges and put in irons by Pedrarias Davila,
“as a traitor and an usurper of the territories of the
crown of Spain.” The enmity of Pedrarias was so bitter
toward the innocent officer that the Spanish governor
of Darien ordered Balboa to be executed. In 1517,
at the age of forty-one years, in the <i>plaza</i> of Acla, the
discoverer of the South Sea was publicly beheaded.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>To further explore the coast of Brazil, it is said that
Juan Diaz de Solis sailed from Lepe, Spain, on the
eighth of October, 1515. Descrying the continent at
Cape San Roque, in five degrees south latitude, he
steered southward along the coast to Rio de Janeiro,
(River of January,) in twenty-three degrees south latitude.
Thence he coasted farther southward and entered
a large bay of fresh water, which he called Mar
Dulce, that was afterward called Rio de la Plata. While
exploring this stream, De Solis, with some of his crew,
went on land, and while ashore was attacked by the
natives, and falling into their hands he and his men
were roasted and devoured. The vessel returned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Cape St. Augustine, and having loaded with Brazil-wood,
sailed to Spain.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The greed of gold, silver, and pearls,—the master
passion governing Spanish capitalists and the horde of
moneyless adventurers at this time in the New World,—was
the cause of the fitting out of three vessels, in 1517,
to go in search of new countries west of the island of
Cuba. This fleet, under the command of Francisco
Hernando de Cordoba, set sail, with one hundred and
ten soldiers, about the beginning of February, from
San Cristobal, on the north side of the island, and after
a voyage of twenty-one days came in sight of the
northeastern part of the peninsula of Yucatan, where
an Indian town was seen, to which the Spaniards gave
the name El Gran Cairo. Near this place three
temples, built of stone and lime, were found, in which
were many clay idols “some of them having terrible
shapes, seemingly representing Indians committing
horrible offences. In these temples,” says Bernal Diaz
del Castillo,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> who was connected with the expedition,
“we also found wooden boxes containing other gods
with hellish faces, several small shells, some ornaments,
three crowns, and a number of trinkets, some in the
shape of fish, others in the shape of ducks, all made of
an inferior kind of gold. Seeing all these things, the
gold and the good architecture of the temples, we felt
overjoyed at the discovery of the country.” At a town,
which the Spaniards called San Lazaro, although they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
were aware that the Indians called it Campeachy, they
were invited to land by the inhabitants, “who wore
fine mantles made of cotton.” “They took us” Diaz
remarks “to some large edifices, which were strongly
built of stone and lime and were in many ways attractive.
These were temples, the walls of which were
covered with figures representing snakes and all kinds
of gods. About an altar we saw several fresh spots of
blood. On some of the idols there were figures like
crosses. There were some paintings representing
groups of Indians. All these greatly astonished us,
for we had neither seen nor heard of such things
before.”</p>

<p>While the explorers were taking in water, near a
village called Potonchan, now Champoton, on the
western side of the peninsula, where there were some
wells, maize-plantations, and stone buildings, the inhabitants
visited them. “They all wore cotton cuirasses
which reached to their knees. They were armed with
bows, lances, shields, and swords. The latter,” Diaz
further remarks, “were shaped like our broad swords,
and are wielded with both hands.” They also had
slings for throwing stones. They had bunches of
feathers on their heads, and had their bodies decorated
with white, brown, and black colors. Speaking of an
engagement which the Spaniards had with the natives,
Diaz says: “As soon as it was daylight we saw more
companies of armed natives moving toward the coast
with flags. They wore feather head-dresses, and were
provided with drums, bows, lances, and shields. They
joined themselves to the others who had arrived in the
night. They divided themselves into corps, surrounded
us on all sides, and began to assail us with so many
arrows, lances, and stones, that more than eight of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
men were wounded in the first onset. They then
rushed furiously forward and attacked us man to man;
some with their lances, others with their swords and
arrows, and with such terrible impetuosity that we were
compelled to show them opposition. We dealt them
many a good thrust and blow, continuing at the same
time an incessant fire with our matchlocks and crossbows;
for while some loaded others fired. At last, by
heavy blows and thrusts we forced them back, but they
did not retreat farther than was necessary to keep
us strongly surrounded.... Perceiving how
closely we were hemmed in on all sides by the enemy,
who not only kept getting fresh troops but were plentifully
supplied in the field with meat, drink, and numbers
of arrows, we soon concluded that all our valiant
fighting would not benefit us. All of us were wounded.
Many were shot through the neck, and more than fifty
of our men were killed. In this critical position we
determined to cut our way manfully through the
enemy’s ranks and get to the boats, which fortunately
lay on the coast near us. We therefore resolutely
closed our ranks and broke through those of the enemy.
You should then have heard the whizzing of their
arrows, the terrible yells of the Indians, and how they
incited one another to fight.... Many of our
men were wounded while climbing into the vessel,
especially those who clung to its side, for the Indians
pursued us in their canoes, and persistently assailed
us. With the utmost exertion and the help of God
we escaped from the hands of this people.”</p>

<p>“Our vessels,” Diaz further relates, “were taken to
Santiago of Cuba, where the governor [Diego Velasquez]
resided. Here the two Indians were brought on
shore whom we had taken with us from Punta de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
Cotoche, as already related, called Melchorejo and
Juanillo. When, however, we brought forth the box
with the crowns, the golden ducks, the fish, the idols,
more noise was made about them than they really
merited, so that they became the common topics of
conversation throughout the islands of St. Domingo
and Cuba; indeed, the report concerning them reached
Spain. There it was said that none of the discovered
countries were as rich as this one, and in none had
there been found houses built of stone. The earthen
gods, it was said, were the heathen relics of ancient
times; others ventured to affirm that they [the people
of Yucatan] were the descendants of the Jews who
had been shipwrecked off this coast, whom Titus and
Vespasian had driven from Jerusalem.... Diego
Velasquez closely questioned the two Indians whether
there were any gold-mines in their country. They
answered in the affirmative; and when they were shown
some of the gold-dust found in the island of Cuba, they
said there was an abundance of it in their country.
This was not true, for it is well known that there are
no gold-mines on the Punta de Cotoche, or anywhere
in the whole of Yucatan. They were likewise shown
the beds in which the seeds of that plant are sown
from whose root the cassava-bread is made, which in
Cuba is called <i>yuca</i>. They assured us that the same
plant grew in their country, and was called by them
<i>tale</i>. As the cassava-root in Cuba is called <i>yuca</i>, and
the ground in which it is planted by the Indians <i>tale</i>,
so from these two words originated the name of the
country, Yucatan; for the Spaniards, who were standing
around the governor at the time that he was speaking
to the two Indians, said: ‘You see, sir, they call
their country Yucatan.’ And from this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the country retained the name of Yucatan, although
the natives call it by a different name.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>“It was in the year of our Lord 1518,” says Diaz,
“after Diego Velasquez had heard the good account
we gave of the newly-discovered country called Yucatan,
that he determined to send another expedition to
it. For this purpose he selected four vessels, among
which were the two in which we soldiers had accompanied
Cordoba on our late voyage to Yucatan, purchased
at our expense.... Our account that
the houses in the newly-discovered country were built
of stone and lime had originated an extraordinary
conception of its riches, besides the Indian Melchorejo
had indicated by signs that it contained
gold-mines. All these things created a great desire
among the inhabitants and soldiers on the island
[Cuba] who possessed no official authority over the
Indians to go in search of a rich country like this one;
consequently, in a very short time, we mustered two
hundred and twenty men.”</p>

<p>Commanded by Juan de Grijalva, the vessels sailed
on the first of May, 1518, from the port of Santiago, Cuba.
After touching at different points, the fleet at last
arrived off the coast of Champoton, on the west side
of Yucatan, where the Indians had attacked the Spaniards
on the last voyage and had driven them to their
vessels. Here they had another engagement with the
natives, but the Spaniards were victorious and put the
enemy to flight. They then proceeded southward to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the bay called La Boca de Terminos, where Diaz relates
“we found temples built of stone and lime, full of idols
made of wood or clay, with other figures, some representing
women, some serpents; also the horns of
various kinds of wild animals. We concluded that
an Indian village was near it.... We have,
however, deceived ourselves, for the district was entirely
uninhabited.”</p>

<p>At a promontory, beyond the bay, toward the
west, about thirty Indians visited the explorers, bringing
with them broiled fish, fowl, fruit, and maize-bread.
“They also,” Diaz relates, “brought pans
filled with red-hot embers, on which they strewed
incense, and perfumed us all. After this ceremony
was ended they spread some mats on the ground, over
which they laid a piece of cotton cloth. On this they
put some trifling ornaments of gold in the shape of
ducks and lizards, with three necklaces made of gold....
They next presented us with some mantles
and waistcoats, such as they wore, and begged of
us to accept them, saying that they had no more gold
to give us, but that farther toward the setting of the
sun there was a country where it was found in great
abundance, at the same time often repeating the word
Culba, and Mexico. We however did not understand
what they meant.”</p>

<p>At a town called Aguajaluco they saw Indians
hurrying to and fro with large shields made of large
tortoise-shells, which glittered so brilliantly in the
sun that some of the Spaniards thought that they
were of inferior gold. At an island, beyond one
which they called Isla Blanca, Diaz relates: “We
found two houses which were strongly built of stone
and lime. Both were ascended by flights of steps, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
had altars, on which stood several abominable idols, to
which, on the previous evening, five Indians had
been sacrificed. Their dead bodies still lay there, cut
open, with the arms and legs chopped off, while every
thing near was besmeared with blood. We contemplated
this sight in utter astonishment, and gave the
island the name of Isla de los Sacrificios.”</p>

<p>At another island farther to the west, Diaz says:
“We found a temple on which stood the great
and abominable-looking god Tetzcatlipuca, surrounded
by four Indians, dressed in wide, black cloaks,
their hair hanging as our canons or Dominicans
wear it. These were the priests, who had that
very day sacrificed two boys, whose bodies they
had cut open and then offered their bleeding hearts
to this horrible idol. They were about to perfume
us in the same way they had done their gods; but
though the perfume smelled like our incense, we
would not permit them so shocked we were at the
sight of the two boys whom they had recently killed,
and we were disgusted with their abominations. Our
captain questioned Francisco, the Indian whom we had
brought with us from the Rio de Banderas, concerning
the purport of all these things, for he seemed to be an
intelligent person, we having, at that time, as I have
already stated, no interpreter. Our captain interrogated
him by signs. Francisco answered that this
sacrifice had been ordered by the people of Culua;
but, as it was difficult for him to pronounce this word,
he repeatedly said, Olua, Olua. In honor of our commander,
whose Christian name was Juan, and as the
day was the feast of St. John, we gave this small island
the name of San Juan de Ulua.”</p>

<p>Sailing northward along the coast of Mexico, “we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
first came,” says Diaz, “in sight of Tusta, and two days
after, of the more elevated mountains of Tuspa, both
of which take their names from two towns close to
these mountains. Along this part of the coast we saw
a number of towns lying from six to nine miles inland.
It is now the province of Panuco.” On account of the
approach of winter, the scarcity of provisions, and the
leaky condition of one of the vessels, the explorers
determined to return to Cuba; Pedro de Alvarador
having previously set sail for the island.</p>

<p>Speaking of their subsequent explorations in the
vicinity of the mouth of the Guacasualco River (now
called Rio Coatzacoalcos, in Tehuantepec), the Spanish
writer says: “As soon as the inhabitants of Guacasualco
and the neighboring districts learned that we
offered our goods for barter, they brought us all their
golden ornaments, and took in exchange green glass
beads, on which they set a high value. Besides ornaments
of gold, each Indian had with him a copper axe,
which was very highly polished, with the handle curiously
carved, that served equally as an ornament and,
on the field of battle, as a weapon. At first we thought
that these axes were made of an inferior kind of gold.
Therefore we began to take them in exchange, and in
the space of two days collected more than six hundred,
with which we were no less pleased, as long as we were
ignorant of their real value, than the Indians were with
our glass beads.... We set sail for Cuba, and
arrived there in the space of forty days.... We
were most graciously welcomed by the governor, Diego
Velasquez, who was highly delighted with the additional
gold we brought him. Altogether, it was well worth
4,000 <i>pesos</i>; so that, with the 16,000 brought over by
Alvarado, the whole amounted to 20,000 <i>pesos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
made this sum greater, some less; but one thing is
certain, the crown officials took only the fifth of the
last-mentioned sum. When they were about to take
the fifth also of the Indian axes, which we had mistaken
for gold, they grew exceedingly angry on finding
them only to be of a fine quality of copper. This
caused the people to laugh at our trading transactions.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the return of Juan de Grijalva,
in 1518, from this voyage, Diego Velasquez, the
governor of Cuba, issued orders for the fitting out of
a larger fleet than the one commanded by the former
officer. Respecting the person who was to have command
of this expedition, Diaz says that “the matter
was secretly settled with Hernando Cortes, by two
confidants of Diego Velasquez, Andres de Duero,
secretary to the governor, and Almador de Lares, the
royal treasurer.... Duero and the royal treasurer,
therefore, employed all their cunning to influence
the governor. They took every opportunity of placing
Cortes in the most favorable light, extolling his
great courage, in a word, declared him to be the most
capable person whom he could intrust with the
command.... Their efforts were crowned
with success, for Diego Velasquez conferred the
appointment of captain-general of the expedition on
that gentleman.... After Hernando Cortes
had been appointed captain, he immediately began to
collect all kinds of arms and ammunition, as matchlocks,
crossbows, powder, and the like. With the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
diligence he took care to provide a large stock of
goods to barter, and other necessaries for our expedition.”
On the eighteenth of February, 1519, the fleet
was on its way toward the west. On the island of
Cozumel, near the eastern coast of Yucatan, Cortes reviewed
his troops. “Without counting the pilots and
marines,” says Diaz, “our number amounted to five
hundred and eight men. There were one hundred
and nine sailors, and sixteen horses.... Our
squadron consisted of eleven vessels of different tonnage....
The number of crossbow men was
thirty-three, and of those bearing matchlocks thirteen.
To these add our heavy guns and four falconets, and
a great quantity of powder and balls. Respecting the
precise number of crossbow men I cannot aver,
though it matters not whether there were a few more
or less.... I have now said all that need be
respecting our armament; indeed, Cortes was very
particular about the merest trifles in these preparations.</p>

<p>“As Cortes paid attention to every circumstance,
he ordered me and Martin Camos of Biscay into his
presence, and asked us what our opinion was of the
word <i>Castilan</i>, <i>Castilan</i>, which the Indians of Campeachy
had so often repeated when we landed there,
under the command of Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba.
We again informed him of every transaction
that had taken place there. He said that he had often
turned this matter over in his mind, and could not help
thinking but that the inhabitants must have some
Spaniards among them, and he thought it would not
be amiss to question the caciques of Cozumel upon this
subject. This Cortes accordingly did, and desired
Melchorejo, who by this time had gained some little
knowledge of the Spanish, and perfectly understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
the language of Cozumel, to question the chiefs about
it. The statements made by them were alike, and
plainly indicated that there were several Spaniards in
the country, whom they had seen; that they as slaves
served the caciques, who lived a march of two days
inland; and that it was within a few days that some
Indian merchants had talked to them.” Some days
afterward Cortes learned that the two Spaniards were
Geronimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. Aguilar
being informed of the presence of the Spaniards
joined them and served Cortes in the important position
of an interpreter.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>When the Spaniards were in camp at the island of
San Juan de Ulua, Cortes was visited, on Easter-day,
by one of the farmer-generals of the Mexican empire,
named Teuthlille. “He was accompanied” says Diaz,
“by another person of distinction called Quitlalpitoc.
We subsequently learned that they were governors of the
provinces of Cotastlan, Tustepec, Guazpaltepec, Tlatateteclo,
and other districts lately subdued. They were
followed by a great number of Indians carrying presents
of fowls and plants. Teuthlille, having ordered the
others to stand aside, advanced to Cortes and bowed
three times very reverentially in the Indian fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
which he did when he turned toward us standing
nearest him. Cortes cordially welcomed them, after
which he embraced them. He desired them to tarry
a while and told them that he would give them a
definite answer [in reply to the question which their
sovereign, the great Montezuma,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> had sent them to ask:
who the Spaniards were and what they came to seek
in his country]. Meanwhile Cortes ordered the altar
to be arranged as prettily as possible. Francisco
Bartolomé and Father Juan Diaz performed mass. The
two governors and the principal personages of their
<i>suite</i> were present during the services, after which
Cortes partook of dinner with them.</p>

<p>“After the table had been cleared, Cortes assisted
by Aguilar and Doña Marina<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> entered into conversation
with the Mexican officials and the caciques, telling
them, that we were Christians, the subjects of the
greatest monarch of the world, named Emperor
Charles,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> that he had many great personages among
his subjects and servants, that we had come by his
command to their country, of which and its powerful
sovereign, who then reigned, his majesty had long
before heard. Cortes speaking of himself said that he
was desirous to become the friend of their sovereign,
and had to disclose many things to him, in the name
of his majesty, the emperor, which their monarch would
listen to with delight. In order that a good understanding
might be established between him [Cortes]
and his [Montezuma’s] subjects, they should acquaint
him with the place where this monarch resided, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
he [Cortes] might pay his respects to him and make
the necessary disclosures. Teuthlille answered in a
rather imperious tone, saying: ‘Inasmuch as you
have lately arrived in this country, it would be more
becoming that before desiring an interview with my
monarch, you should accept this present, which we
have brought you in his name, and then disclose your
wishes to me.’ He then took from a box, a quantity
of gold-trinkets, of beautiful and artistic workmanship,
and more than twenty packages of stuffs very prettily
made of white cotton and feathers. These they presented
to Cortes, besides various other costly gifts
which, on account of the number of years that has intervened,
I cannot now remember, together with provisions,
as fowl, fruit, and dried fish. Cortes accepted
all these with a pleased expression, and presented these
gentlemen in return with glass beads resembling brilliants,
and other things that we had brought from Spain.
He begged them to request the inhabitants of the different
districts to begin trading with us, for we possessed
various articles which we desired to exchange
for gold. This they promised to do.</p>

<p>“Cortes then ordered an arm-chair, beautifully
painted and adorned with inlaid work, to be brought,
also some pieces of precious stones, wrapped in cotton
cloth, perfumed with musk, a necklace of imitation
pearls, a scarlet cap, with a medal, on which was represented
the holy St. George on horseback, with lance
in hand, killing the dragon. Cortes then addressed
Teuthlille, and said that he presented the chair to his
monarch, Montezuma, that he might sit in it when he
should pay him a visit, and the string of pearls to wind
around his head on the same occasion, all of which
presents were from our sovereign, the emperor, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
had sent them to Montezuma in token of friendship
and as a proof of the esteem in which he held him.
Cortes further remarked that Teuthlille should inform
us where and when he, Cortes, could personally have
an audience with the monarch. Teuthlille accepted
the presents, and said in reply that his master, Montezuma,
as he also was a great monarch, would in turn
be equally delighted to learn something about our
great emperor; that he would hasten to lay the presents
before him, and to return with his answer.</p>

<p>“Teuthlille had with him very skillful painters, for
there were such in Mexico, and he ordered them to
paint the portrait and entire person of Cortes, with the
dress he wore; also the pictures of all the other chief
officers, the soldiers, our ships, horses, Doña Marina,
and Aguilar, even our two dogs, the cannon, the balls,
in short, every thing that they could see that belonged
to us. The paintings they took along with them to
show to their monarch.”</p>

<p>After an absence of about six or seven days, Teuthlille
returned, as Diaz further observes, “with more
than a hundred Indian porters, all heavily laden,
accompanied by a great Mexican cacique, who, in
countenance, stature, and deportment, greatly resembled
Cortes, and on that account had been selected by
his monarch to accompany the deputation. For, as it
was related, when Teuthlille presented the picture
representing Cortes, all the grandees who were
present with their monarch, Montezuma, immediately
observed that he resembled a person of distinction
named Quintalbor. This was the same person who
now accompanied Teuthlille. We therefore called one
the Cortes of this place, and the other the Cortes of
that place. We must now, however, tell what the embassadors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
did when they came into the presence of
Cortes. First of all they touched the ground at his
feet with their hands. They then perfumed him and
all the Spaniards who were present, with pans made
of clay. Cortes gave them a very cordial reception,
and desired them to sit down at his side. Quintalbor,
the cacique, was commissioned to discuss matters jointly
with Teuthlille. The two, therefore, told Cortes
that he was most welcome to visit their country, and
after considerable talking on both sides, they produced
the presents”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> sent him by Montezuma. As is further
related by the Spanish historian, Juan de Torquemada,
a contemporary of Diaz, “the embassador of Montezuma
ordered mats to be spread on the ground before
Cortes, and over them some cotton cloth, on which he
arranged the presents, comprising many cotton shirts,
and great quantities of other cotton stuffs, beautifully
manufactured, and interwoven with feathers of the
most splendid colors. There were shields made of
the purest white stuffs, decorated with feathers, gold,
silver, and pearls, surpassing everything in beauty and
skilled workmanship that ever was seen. There was
also a helmet, tastefully carved out of wood, filled with
grains of gold; also a casque, made of thin plates of
gold, decorated with tassels, and with stones resembling
the emerald. There were numerous large bunches of
feathers of different colors, set in silver and gold;
fans for keeping off flies, made of the rarest feathers;
a thousand lockets of gold and silver of the most curious
and beautiful workmanship; bracelets and military
decorations of gold and silver, splendidly embossed
with green and bright yellow feathers; leather made
of deer skin, curried and colored in the best possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
manner; shoes and sandals of the same leather,
sewed with thin gold-wire, and the soles of beautiful
white and blue stone. There were other kinds of
shoes, very tastefully made of cotton; mirrors of marcasite,
globular-shaped, of the size of one’s fist, and
most ingeniously set in gold, the small frame itself
being very valuable, and worthy of the acceptance of
any crowned head; coverings and curtains to beds,
manufactured of variously colored cotton, more glossy
and of a finer texture than silk; a number of other gold
and silver trinkets; a necklace of gold, decorated with
more than a hundred emeralds, rubies, and various ornaments
of gold; a second necklace of many large
pearls and emeralds, all of the most exquisite workmanship;
numerous gold trinkets in the shape of frogs
and animals; jewels in the form of medals. The cases
were even more valuable than the precious stones they
contained. There was also a quantity of large and
small grains of gold. The most valuable of these
presents, however, were two round plates, one of gold,
on which was a sun with rays and the zodiac. This
weighed more than one hundred marks.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The other
plate was of silver, which in a similar manner represented
the moon. It weighed about fifty marks. The
two disks were massive and of the thickness of the
Spanish coin of four silver reals, and as large as carriage-wheels.
Those who saw these splendid presents
said that, without considering the beautiful workmanship,
the value of the gold and silver alone amounted
to twenty-five thousand <i>castellanos de oro</i>; so that the
full value of all these presents may rightly be estimated
at fifty thousand ducats.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“When Quintalbor, the great cacique, and Teuthlille,
presented these gifts to Cortes,” as Diaz further
relates, “they begged him to accept of them in the
same spirit of friendship with which their monarch
sent them, and to distribute them among his <i>teules</i>.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
Thereupon they began to tell what their monarch had
particularly commissioned them to say, which was as
follows: ‘He, Montezuma, was delighted with the
arrival of such courageous men in his provinces, for,
according to the accounts he had received, and judging
from the occurrence at Tabasco [where Cortes had had
an engagement with the natives], we certainly must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
brave men. He wished very much to see our great
emperor who was so powerful, of whom, although
residing at so great a distance, he had already gained
some knowledge, and he would send him a present of
some valuable stones. He was likewise ready to
furnish us with every thing we might require during
our stay. Respecting Cortes visiting him, the undertaking
should not engage our thoughts, for it was not
necessary, and would be attended with great difficulties.’</p>

<p>“Cortes thanked them most sincerely for their
kindness, gave each several shirts made of Holland
linen, some blue beads, and other trifles, and requested
them when they returned to their great monarch to
tell him that our emperor and master would deem it
very unkind, after we had come from such distant
countries and crossed such vast seas, solely with the
intention of paying our respects to Montezuma, if we
returned without accomplishing this object. He
wished, therefore, to proceed to his residence, and
to receive personally his commands. The embassadors
answered that they would convey these messages to
their monarch, and that a visit to him was unnecessary.
Cortes thereupon gave them out of our poverty a cup
of Florentine workmanship, gilded and ornamented
with wreaths of leaves in relief, and the shirts made of
Holland linen, and other things, all of which were to
be presented to Montezuma, together with Cortes’s
message. The two emissaries then departed, while
Quitlalpitoc alone remained behind in our camp, commissioned,
as it appeared, by the two other officials of
Montezuma, to provide provisions for us from the
neighboring districts.</p>

<p>“After the Mexican embassadors had taken their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
departure, Cortes ordered two vessels to sail farther
northward and explore the coast. The command of
these was given to Francisco de Montejo, with orders
to follow the same course taken by Grijalva....
Montejo departed, and sailed to the Rio Grande, near
Panuco, as far as we had gone with Grijalva. On
account of the strong currents he could not proceed
any farther. He therefore returned to San Juan de
Ulua....</p>

<p>“One morning the Indians, who had dwelt near us
in huts, and had furnished us with provisions and
brought gold to barter, secretly departed with Quitlalpitoc.
This, we subsequently learned, was done by
the orders of Montezuma. He had forbidden all intercourse
with Cortes, believing that he was obeying the
commands of his idol-gods. These were named Tetzcatlipuca
and Huitzilopochtli; the former being the
god of hell, and the latter the god of war, to whom
Montezuma daily sacrificed a number of children in
order that the gods might disclose to him what he
should do with us. He intended to take us prisoners
should we not re-embark—employing some to educate
children, and sacrificing the others. His idol-gods, as
we afterward learned, advised him not to listen to
Cortes, and to pay no attention to the message that
we had sent him respecting the cross and the image of
the Blessed Virgin. This was what caused his men to
go away so secretly.</p>

<p>“This being the condition of affairs, we daily expected
that hostilities would begin, and we were
therefore the more vigilant. It happened one day,
while I was standing sentinel on the sand-hills with
another soldier, that we espied five Indians coming
along the shore. Not to alarm the camp with so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
trifling a matter, we allowed them to advance. They
all appeared very good-humored, made their obeisance
to us after their fashion, and requested us, by signs, to
conduct them to the camp. Thereupon I said to my
companion: ‘I will take them there, while you remain
where you are,’ for at that time my legs were not so
infirm as they are now, in my old age. When I presented
them to Cortes, they manifested the utmost
reverence, and continually repeated the word <i>Lopelucio</i>,
<i>Lopelucio</i>, which in the Totonac language means lord,
great god. In dress and language these people
differed entirely from the Mexicans whom Montezuma
had sent to our camp. They had large holes bored in
their under-lips, in which they wore pieces of a
speckled, blue stone, or thin plates of gold. The holes
in their ears were quite large, from which depended
similar ornaments. Neither Aguilar nor Doña Marina
understood their language. The latter asked them
whether there were any <i>naëyavatos</i> or interpreters
with them. Thereupon two of them answered that
they understood the Mexican language. Then the
talking began. They bid us welcome, and said that
their ruler had sent them to inquire who we were, and
that he would be delighted to be of any use to such
powerful men as we were. They said that they would
have waited on us earlier, if they had not shunned the
people of Culhua, namely, the Mexicans (meaning as
much as villains), who had been with us. It is likely
that these people had heard of our battles at Tabasco
and Potonchan. They at least knew that the Mexicans
had secretly departed from us three days before
this time. Cortes learned many things from them
which were of the greatest importance to him, particularly
the information respecting the enemies and opponents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
of Montezuma. Cortes, therefore, was very
friendly to these people. He gave them a number of
presents, and desired them to return to their ruler and
to tell him that he would in person shortly visit him.”</p>

<p>The indomitable commander now advanced northward
along the coast as far as Chiahuitzla, near the
roadstead where his ships were anchored. A short
distance from this place Cortes began to build the city
to which he gave the name Villa Rica de Vera Cruz
(the Rich Town of the True Cross). From the port of
the new city, Cortes, on the twenty-sixth of July, 1519,
dispatched a ship to Spain, under the command of
Alonso Puertocarrero and Francisco de Montejo, carrying
letters to the emperor, Charles V., with accounts
of the invasion of New Spain. With these communications
were sent some of the presents that Cortes had
received, besides several cotton and agave-scrolls of
Mexican hieroglyphics. “Our agents took charge of
the letters,” Diaz remarks, “and were bound by a
promise not to touch at the Havannah under any pretext
whatever, or to enter the harbor of El Marien,
where Francisco de Montejo had possessions. This
was done in order that Diego Velasquez might not
receive any intelligence of our movements.”</p>

<p>The resolute officer, having ordered his ships to
be destroyed, began about the middle of August his
march toward the city of Mexico,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> with his small band
of about five hundred followers, fifteen horsemen, and
seven pieces of artillery. He took with him thirteen
hundred native warriors from Cempoalla, besides a
thousand porters to transport the camp-baggage, provisions,
and munition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>In the province of Xocotlan the invaders came to
an Indian town called by the Spaniards Castilblanco,
governed by a cacique who was subject to Montezuma.
The hospitable ruler described to Cortes the situation
of the city of Mexico, which was built on an island
surrounded by water, and approachable on foot by
three bridged causeways.</p>

<p>“A certain place in this province,” says Diaz, “I
shall never forget. Here a vast number of human
skulls were piled in the best manner imaginable.
There must have been more than one hundred thousand;
I repeat, more than one hundred thousand. In
the same orderly way the remaining human bones
were piled in another corner of the square. The latter
it would have been impossible to count. Besides these
bones there were human heads hanging from beams
on both sides of the square.” On the first, second, and
fifth days of September, near the village of Tehuacacinco,
Cortes had victorious engagements with the
Tlascallans.</p>

<p>“It also happened,” Diaz further remarks, “that
the powerful king of Mexico, Montezuma, either in the
great goodness of his heart, or because he began to
fear our approach to his metropolis, dispatched five
men of distinction to our camp in the province of
Tlascalla to congratulate us on our advance, and to
assure us of the great delight he felt when he heard of
the splendid victories we had gained over such large
armies. This message was sent with a valuable present
of gold trinkets, differently elaborated, worth about
one thousand <i>pesos</i>, and also packages of cotton stuffs,
as much as twenty men could carry. He also wished
us to know, that it was his desire to become a subject
of our emperor, that he was greatly pleased to learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
that we were so near his metropolis, and that he was
every way well-disposed toward Cortes and all the
<i>teules</i>, his brothers. He likewise wished to be told by
us what annual tribute in gold, silver, jewels, and cotton
stuffs he was to forward to our great emperor,
which tribute would save us the trouble of coming to
Mexico, adding that he should indeed be pleased to
see us, but that our march would be a hazardous undertaking
through a sterile and rocky country, and that
the fatigues which we should have to undergo grieved
him the more when he considered how impossible it
was for him to remove the hindrances from the way.”</p>

<p>Cortes shortly afterward marched into the city of
Tlascalla, where, when they entered it, “the streets
and balconies could scarcely contain the number of
men and women” who welcomed them. “Delight
was depicted on every countenance,” and “twenty
baskets full of roses” were “presented to Cortes and
the soldiers, whom the citizens thought were officers,
and particularly to those who were on horseback.”
Here Cortes was told by one of the principal men of
the place “that Montezuma had strong garrisons in
every town, besides the warriors who marched out
from the metropolis to the field of battle. Every
province was compelled to pay him tribute in gold,
silver, feathers, precious stones, cotton stuffs, as well
as Indians of both sexes, some of whom he took into
his service, and some he sacrificed. He was a monarch
so powerful and wealthy that he accomplished
and obtained all he desired. His palaces were filled
with riches and <i>chalchihuis</i> stones,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> which he seized
wherever he went. In short, all the wealth of the
country was in his possession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>Cortes was further told that the city of Mexico
“was abundantly supplied with fresh water from the
spring of Chapultepec, which was about two miles
from the city, whence the water was partly conveyed
to the houses by means of pipes, and partly in boats
through the canals, when it was sold in small quantities
to the inhabitants. Respecting the weapons of
this nation, they included two-edged lances that were
projected by means of a thong and penetrated any
cuirass. The warriors were excellent marksmen with
the bow and arrow, and carried pikes with blades of
flint, which were very ingeniously made, and were as
sharp as razors. Besides these weapons, they carried
shields, and wore cotton cuirasses. There was also a
great number of slingers, who were provided with
round stones, long pikes, and sharp swords which were
wielded with both hands.</p>

<p>“To explain all these things, the caciques exhibited
large pieces of <i>nequen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> on which were pictured
their battles and their art of warfare. When
Cortes and we considered that we had gained sufficient
information concerning these things, the conversation
turned to subjects of greater importance. Our
friends told us how and whence they came into this
country, and how they settled there; how it had happened,
notwithstanding their nearness to the Mexicans,
that they resembled them so little, and lived in
perpetual warfare with each other. A tradition was
also handed down from their forefathers that in
ancient times a race of men and women lived here
who were immense in stature with large bones, and
who were a very bad and evil-disposed people,
whom they had mostly exterminated by continual war,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
and the few that had been spared, had in the course
of time died.</p>

<p>“In order to give us a conception of the huge
frames of these people, they dragged forth a bone, or
rather a thigh-bone, of one of the giants, which was very
strong, and measured the length of a man of good
stature. This bone was still entire from the knee to
the hip-joint. I measured it with my own person, and
found it to be of my own length, although I am a man
of considerable height. They showed us many similar
pieces of bones, but they were all worm-eaten and decayed.
We, however, did not doubt for a moment,
that the country was once inhabited by giants. Cortes
remarked that we ought to forward these bones
to his majesty in Spain at the very earliest opportunity.”</p>

<p>Montezuma again sent embassadors to Cortes
bearing presents. They said “that their monarch
could not but feel astonished that we” as Diaz relates,
“had made so long a stay among a poor and
uncivilized people, who were not fit for slaves, but so
viciously disposed, so treacherous and thievish, that
some day or night when we least apprehended it they
would kill us merely for the sake of plunder. Montezuma
begged us to visit his city, where, at least, we
might enjoy the good things it offered, even though
these should be below our deserts, and not equal to
what he could wish.... Cortes thanked the
embassadors in a very flattering manner for their
civilities and the expressions of friendship they had
conveyed to him from their monarch, and he desired
them to tell their sovereign that in a short time he
would pay his respects to him.”</p>

<p>At Cholula, to which Cortes next marched, a plot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
was concocted to kill the Spaniards, but being warned,
they were on their guard and severely punished the
inhabitants for their treacherous conduct. Describing
the city, Diaz says: “Cholula had more than a hundred
very high towers, they were all <i>cues</i> or temples, in
which human sacrifices were offered and idols stood.
The principal temple was even higher than the one in
the city of Mexico, though the latter was really magnificent
and very high. The temple [at Cholula] is
said to have contained one hundred courts, and an
idol of enormous dimensions, (the name of which I
have forgotten), which was in great repute, and people
came from various places to sacrifice human beings to
it and bring offerings for the dead. I well remember
when we first entered the city and beheld the elevated
white temples, how the whole place reminded us all of
Valladolid.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> ... I must add a word or two respecting
the wooden cages we saw in this city. They
were constructed of heavy timber, and filled with grown
men and little boys, who were fattening for the sacrifices
and feasts. Cortes ordered these diabolical cages
to be pulled down, and sent the prisoners to their
homes.”</p>

<p>While Cortes was on his way to the city of Mexico
from Cholula, another embassy from Montezuma met
him, bringing him again presents of gold and cotton
fabrics. Montezuma desired the embassadors to
express his regrets for the many hardships which
Cortes was compelled to endure on his wearisome
journey to see his person, that he would send to the
port on the coast a great quantity of gold, silver, and
jewels for the emperor, that he would present Cortes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
himself with four loads of gold, and one load for each
of his companions, but that he forbade him to enter
the city of Mexico, as all his troops were under arms
to oppose him. “On this occasion” says Diaz, “Cortes
again told the embassadors that he was surprised that
their sovereign, who had called himself our friend so
often and was so powerful a monarch, should so frequently
change his mind, to desire a thing one day
and not want it the next. Respecting the presents of
gold for our emperor and ourselves, Cortes told them
that we were thankful for Montezuma’s kind intentions,
and also for the gifts they brought with them,
and that he would certainly some day render their
monarch valuable services in return. He asked them
if it were right after we had advanced within so short
a distance of the metropolis to return home without
fulfilling our monarch’s commission. He said that
Montezuma should place himself in our position and
consider, had he sent embassadors to a monarch of his
own rank, whether he would be pleased, if they returned
home after going almost to his palace without
seeing that monarch or fulfilling their commission to
him.... Therefore he begged that their monarch
would not thereafter send any more embassadors
with such messages. Cortes further said that he was
determined to see and speak to Montezuma personally,
and to inform him of the object of our mission.
All that we asked was only an audience, for the
moment our stay in his metropolis became irksome to
him we would depart and return to the place whence
we had come.... With this answer Cortes
sent the embassadors back to their monarch, and we
continued our march....</p>

<p>“After Montezuma learned our answer to his message<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
he dispatched his nephew, Cacamatzin, prince of
Tezcuco, to us, in great pomp to bid us welcome....
The conference being ended, we continued
our march. We were accompanied by the caciques
and their numerous attendants, besides all the inhabitants
of the neighborhood, who had come to meet us,
so that we could hardly move for the vast crowds of
people.</p>

<p>“The next morning we reached the broad high
road of Iztapalapan, from which we for the first time
beheld the number of cities and villages built in the
lake [of Tezcuco], and the still greater number of large
towns on the main-land and along the level causeway,
which ran in a straight line to the city of Mexico.
Our astonishment was exceedingly great, and we could
not but remark to one another, that all the buildings
resembled the fairy castles of which we read in Amadis
of Gaul; so high, majestically, and splendidly did the
temples, towers, and houses of the city, all built of
massive stone and lime, rise above the water of the
lake. Indeed, many of our men believed what they
saw was the creation of a dream. And the reader
must not be surprised at the manner in which I have
expressed myself, for it is impossible to speak composedly
of things which we have never before seen or
heard of, or could have dreamed of.... We
now entered the city of Iztapalapan, where we were
quartered in palaces of large dimensions surrounded
by spacious courts, and built of hewn stone, cedar, and
other sweet-scented wood. All the apartments were
curtained with cotton drapery.</p>

<p>“After we had seen all these things we visited the
gardens adjoining the palaces, which were so exceedingly
attractive that I could not gratify myself enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
by walking about in them and contemplating the number
of trees which exhaled the most delightful odors,
and the rose-bushes, the different flower-beds, and the
fruit-trees which stood along the paths. Here was a
pond of fresh water connected with the lake by a small
canal. The canal was constructed of stone of different
colors, and decorated with numerous figures, and was
wide enough to hold the largest canoes. In the basin
various kinds of water-fowl were swimming to and
fro, and every thing was so charming and so beautiful
that we could find no words to express our astonishment....
But now there is not a vestige of all
these things remaining, and not a stone of the beautiful
city left in its place.... Iztapalapan was a
city of considerable magnitude, built partly in the
water and partly on the land. Its site is now all dry
land, and where vessels once sailed to and fro seeds
are sown and harvests gathered. Indeed, the whole
face of the country is so completely changed that he
who had not seen these places previously, would hardly
believe that waves had once rolled over the spot where
fertile maize-plantations are now, so wonderfully has
every thing been changed here in a short space of
time.</p>

<p>“On the following morning we left Iztapalapan, accompanied
by all the principal caciques already mentioned.
The road on which we marched was eight
paces wide, and, if I rightly remember, ran straight
to the city of Mexico. Notwithstanding the breadth
of the causeway it was much too narrow for the great
throngs of people that were constantly arriving from
different places to gaze at us, and we could hardly
move forward. Besides the tops of all the temples and
towers were crowded with spectators, and below them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the lake was covered with canoes filled with Indians,
for all the people were eager to catch a glimpse of us.
And who can wonder at this curiosity, for neither men
like us nor horses had ever been seen here before.</p>

<p>“When we surveyed all this splendor we scarcely
knew what to think, and we doubted whether all that
we beheld were real. A succession of large cities
stretched along the banks of the lake [of Tezcuco],
from which much larger ones rose magnificently above
the water. Innumerable canoes were plying near us.
At regular intervals we crossed new bridges, and before
us lay the great city of Tenustitlan Mexico in all
its grandeur.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> And we, who were beholding this
spectacle, who were passing through this dense concourse
of human beings, were a mere handful of men,
in all four hundred and fifty, our minds filled with the
warnings of the inhabitants of Huexotzinco, Tlascalla,
and Tlalmanalco, and the caution they had given us
not to expose our lives to the treachery of the Mexicans.
I ask the kind reader to reflect a moment, and
then to say whether he believes any men in this world
ever attempted so bold an undertaking.</p>

<p>“When we had arrived at a place where another
narrow causeway led toward Cojohuacan we were met
by a number of caciques and distinguished personages,
all attired in rich raiment. They had been dispatched
by Montezuma to meet us and bid us welcome in his
name. As a manifestation of their good-will they
touched the ground with their hands and kissed it.
We now halted for a few minutes to permit the princes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
of Tezcuco, Iztapalapan, Tlacupa, and Cojohuacan, to
get in advance to meet Montezuma, who was slowly
approaching, surrounded by other grandees of the kingdom,
seated in a splendid portable chair. When
we arrived at a place near the city, where there
were several towers, the monarch raised himself
in his chair, supported by a number of distinguished
caciques, who held over his head a canopy of very
great value, decorated with green feathers, gold, silver,
<i>chalchihuis</i> stones and pearls. The bordering of the
canopy ornamented with these things was exceedingly
attractive.</p>

<p>“Montezuma, according to his habit, was richly
attired. His half boots were profusely decorated with
jewels, the soles were of solid gold. The four grandees
who supported him were also richly clad. They must
have put on this clothing somewhere on the road,
before they went to attend Montezuma, for they were
not so magnificently dressed when they first came to
meet us. Besides these distinguished caciques, there
were many other grandees around the monarch, some
of whom held the canopy over his head while others
again occupied the road before him, and spread cotton
cloths that his feet might not touch the bare
ground. No one of his attendants ever looked at
him full in the face. Every one in his presence stood
with eyes downcast, and it was only his four nephews
and cousins, who supported him, that dared to look up.</p>

<p>“When it was announced to Cortes that Montezuma
was approaching, he alighted from his horse and
advanced to meet him. Many compliments passed
between them. Montezuma welcomed Cortes, who,
through Doña Marina, said, in turn, that he hoped his
majesty was in good health. If I still remember rightly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Cortes, who had Doña Marina next to him, wished to
concede the place of honor to the monarch, who, however,
would not accept of it, but yielded it to Cortes,
who then took a necklace of precious stones of very
beautiful colors and shapes, strung upon gold wire and
perfumed with musk, and placed it on the neck of Montezuma.
Our commander was then about to embrace
him, but the grandees, who surrounded Montezuma,
held back Cortes’s arms, for they considered the act
improper. Our general then desired Doña Marina to
tell the monarch that he [Cortes] congratulated himself
exceedingly on his good fortune of having seen so
powerful a monarch face to face, and to thank him for
the honor of coming to meet us. Montezuma replied
in very appropriate words, and ordered his two
nephews, the princes of Tezcuco and Cojohuacan, to
conduct us to our quarters. He then returned to the
city, accompanied by his two other relatives, the princes
of Cuitlahuac and Tlacupa, and the other grandees of
his large retinue. As they passed, we observed how
all those who composed his majesty’s escort held their
heads bent forward, no one daring to lift up his eyes in
his presence, and also the deep veneration with which
he was regarded....</p>

<p>“We were quartered in a large building where there
was room enough for us all.... Near it were
temples and Mexican idols. This building had been
purposely selected for us because we were termed
<i>teules</i>, or were thought to be, and that we might dwell
among the gods as among our equals. The apartments
and halls were very spacious, and those set
apart for our general were furnished with carpets.
Each one of us had a separate bed, which could not
have been better furnished for a gentleman of the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
rank. Each apartment was swept clean, and the walls
were newly plastered and decorated.</p>

<p>“When we had entered into the great court-yard of
this palace, Montezuma came to Cortes, and, taking
him by the hand, conducted him to the apartments
where he was to lodge, which had been prettily decorated
after the fashion of the country. He then hung
about his neck a chased necklace of gold, most curiously
wrought with figures of crabs. The Mexican
grandees were greatly amazed at all these uncommon
favors which their monarch bestowed upon our general.</p>

<p>“Cortes returned the monarch many thanks for so
much kindness, and the latter took leave of him with
these words: ‘Malinche,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> you and your brothers
must now do as if you were at home, and take some
rest after the fatigues of the journey.’ He then returned
to his palace, which was near.” This was on
the eighth of November, 1519. Later in the day
Montezuma again visited Cortes, and held a long conversation
with him. On the following day Cortes had
an audience with Montezuma in his palace.</p>

<p>“The mighty Montezuma,” Diaz further observes,
“may have been about this time in the fortieth year of
his age. He was tall, slender, and thin; but his body
was well-proportioned. His complexion was not very
brown, almost the same as that of the inhabitants.
His hair was not long, excepting where it hung thickly
over his ears, which were hid by it. His black beard,
though thin, was handsome. His face was somewhat
long, but he had a cheerful countenance, and his fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
eyes had an expression of amiability or of ill-will
according to his humor. He was particularly clean in
appearance, and took a bath every evening. Besides
a number of concubines, who were all daughters of
note and rank, he had two lawful wives of royal extraction,
whom, however, he visited secretly without
any one daring to observe him, except his most confidential
servants.... In the halls adjoining his
private apartments there was always a guard of two
thousand men of high station in waiting, with whom,
however, he never held any conversation unless to give
them orders or to receive some intelligence from them....
In cold weather when he dined a large fire was
made of the charcoal of the bark of trees, which emitted
no smoke but a delightful perfume. That his majesty
might not feel any discomfort from the heat of the fire,
a screen was placed between him and it, made of gold,
and adorned with the different figures of their gods.
The chair on which he sat was somewhat low. It was
filled with soft cushions and beautifully carved. The
table was higher, and suited to the seat. The former
was covered with white cloths, one of which was large.
Four very neat and pretty women held before the
monarch a round pitcher, called by them <i>xicales</i>,
filled with water to wash his hands. The water was
caught in other vessels, and then the young women
presented him with towels to dry his hands. Two other
women brought him maize-bread baked with eggs.
Before Montezuma began to dine, a wooden screen,
elaborately gilded, was placed before him, that no one
might see him while eating. Then the young women
stood at a distance. Four elderly men of high rank
came to his table, whom he addressed from time to
time or asked them some question. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
would offer them a plate of his food, which was considered
a mark of great favor. The gray-haired, aged
men, that were so highly honored, were, as we subsequently
learned, his nearest relatives, his most trustworthy
counsellors, and chief justices. Whenever he
ordered any viands to be given them, they ate standing
with the greatest reverence, not daring to look at
him full in the face. The dishes in which the food was
served were of variegated and black porcelain, made at
Cholula. While the monarch was at table his courtiers
and those who were waiting in the adjoining halls
maintained strict silence....</p>

<p>“Sometimes during dinner he had ugly humpbacked
dwarfs to act as buffoons and perform antics
for his amusement. At other times he had jesters
to enliven him with their witticisms. Others again
danced and sung before him. Montezuma took great
delight in these entertainments, and ordered the
broken victuals and pitchers of cacao-liquor (chocolate)
to be distributed among the performers. When
he had dined the four women took away the cloths
and brought him water to wash his hands. During
this interval he conversed a little with the four old
men, and then left the table to enjoy his afternoon-sleep.</p>

<p>“After the monarch had dined, dinner was served
for the men on duty and the other officers of his household.
I often counted more than one thousand dishes
on the table of the kinds already mentioned. Then
followed, according to the Mexican custom, the frothing
jugs of cacao-liquor, as many as two thousand,
after which came different kinds of fruit in great abundance.
Then the women dined who superintended
the baking department, and those who made the cacao-liquor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
with the young women who waited upon the
monarch....</p>

<p>“Besides these servants were many butlers, house-stewards,
treasurers, cooks, and superintendents of
maize-magazines.... I had almost forgotten
to mention, that while the monarch dined two other
young women of great beauty brought him small
cakes, as white as snow, made of eggs and other
nourishing ingredients, on plates covered with clean
napkins; also a long-shaped loaf made of very substantial
things, and <i>pachol</i> (a wafer-cake). They then
brought him three beautifully painted and gilded tubes
filled with liquid-amber and an herb called by the Indians
<i>tabaco</i>. After the dinner had been removed and
the singing and dancing ended, one of these tubes was
lighted. The monarch drew the smoke into his mouth,
and after he had done this a short time he would fall
asleep.</p>

<p>“At this time a celebrated cacique, whom we called
Topia, was Montezuma’s chief steward. He kept an
account of the whole of Montezuma’s revenue, in large
books of paper which the Mexicans called <i>amatl</i>. A
house was filled with these large account-books.</p>

<p>“Montezuma had also two arsenals filled with arms
of all kinds, many of which were ornamented with gold
and precious stones. The arms comprised shields of
different sizes, swords, and a broad-sword wielded with
both hands, the edge of flint so extremely sharp that
the swords cut much better than our Spanish ones.
There were also lances, longer than ours, pointed at
the end, a fathom long, set with several sharp flints.
The pikes are so very sharp and hard that they will
pierce the strongest shield, and cut like a razor; so
that the Mexicans even shave themselves with these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
flints. There were also excellent bows and arrows,
pikes with single and double points, and suitable thongs
to project them; slings, with round stones purposely
made for them; also large shields, so ingeniously made
that they could be rolled up when not wanted. These
shields are unrolled on the field of battle, and completely
cover the whole body from the head to the
feet. We also saw a great many kinds of cuirasses
made of quilted cotton, which were adorned on the
outside with soft feathers of different colors, and looked
like uniforms. We also saw morions and helmets constructed
of wood and bones, adorned with feathers.
There were artificers always at work, who continually
augmented this store of arms; and the arsenals were
under the care of certain persons, who also superintended
the manufacturing departments....</p>

<p>“I will now advert to another subject, and acquaint
my readers with the fine arts of the Mexicans. I will
first speak of the sculptors, and the gold and silversmiths
who were skillful in working and smelting gold.
The latter would have astonished the most celebrated
of our Spanish goldsmiths. They were many, and the
most expert lived at a place called Ezcapuzalco, about
four miles from Mexico. The next in proficiency were
very skillful masters in cutting and polishing precious
stones and the <i>calchihuis</i> stone, which resembles the
emerald. These were followed by the great masters
in painting, and the decorators in feathers, and the
wonderful sculptors. Even now there are still living
in Mexico three Indian artists, named Marcos de
Aguino, Juan de la Cruz, and El Crespello, who
severally have attained so high a place in the art of
painting and sculpture, that each may be compared to
an Apelles, or to our contemporaries, Michael Angelo
and [Alonso] Berruguette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“The women were remarkably skillful in weaving
and embroidery, and they made quantities of the
finest stuffs, interwoven with feathers. The common
stuffs for daily use came from certain districts in the
province of Costatlan, which lay on the north coast,
not far from Vera Cruz, where we first landed with
Cortes.</p>

<p>“The concubines in the palace of Montezuma, who
were all daughters of distinguished men, were employed
in manufacturing the most beautiful stuffs, interwoven
with feathers. Similar fabrics were made by
certain women who dwelt secluded in cloisters as our
nuns.... Montezuma had in his service a
great number of stone-cutters, masons, and carpenters,
who were only employed about the royal palaces. Here
I must not forget to speak of his gardens for the
cultivation of flowers, trees and vegetables, of which
there were various kinds. In these gardens were
many baths, wells, basins, and ponds full of limpid water,
which regularly ebbed and flowed. These gardens
were made more attractive by innumerable species of
small birds, which sang among the trees. The gardens
of medicinal plants and vegetables may also be mentioned.
They were cultivated by a large body of gardeners.
All the baths, wells, ponds and buildings were
substantially constructed of stone, as were also the
theatres where the singers and dancers performed.</p>

<p>“We had been four days in the city of Mexico,”
Diaz further remarks, “and neither our commander
nor any of us had, during this time, left our quarters,
except to visit the gardens and buildings adjoining
the palace. Cortes therefore determined to view the
city, and to visit the great market and the chief temple
of Huitzilopochtli. He accordingly sent Geronimo de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Aguilar, Doña Marina, and one of his pages, named
Orteguilla, who, by this time, understood a little of the
Mexican language, to Montezuma, to request his permission
to inspect the different buildings of the city.
Montezuma readily granted us permission to go where
we pleased, although he was apprehensive that we
might intentionally injure the one or the other of his
idols. He therefore determined to accompany us with
some of his principal officers, and, for this purpose, left
his palace with a showy retinue....</p>

<p>“Our commander, attended by the greater part of
our horsemen and foot-soldiers, all well armed, as we
were at all times, proceeded to the Tlatelulco. By command
of Montezuma, a number of caciques met us on
our way thither. When we arrived in this immense
market, we were greatly astonished to see the vast
number of people, the profusion of merchandise exposed
for sale, and the admirable police-system, and
the order that everywhere existed. The grandees
who accompanied us drew our attention to the smallest
circumstance, and gave us an explanation of all we
saw. Each class of merchandise had a separate place
for its sale. We first visited those divisions of the
market set apart for the sale of gold and silver wares,
jewels, cloths interwoven with feathers, and other
manufactured goods, where also slaves of both sexes
were sold. The slave-market was upon as great a scale
as the Portuguese market for negro slaves at Guinea.
To prevent the slaves from running away, they were
fastened by halters around their necks, though some
were allowed to walk at large. Next to these divisions
were the dealers in coarser wares, cotton, twisted
thread, and cacao. In short, all kinds of commodities
produced in New Spain [Yucatan and Mexico] were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
here to be found. The market reminded me of my
native town of Medino del Campo at fair-time, where
each kind of merchandise has a separate street assigned
for its sale. In one place were sold the stuffs
manufactured of <i>nequen</i>, as ropes and sandals. In
another place, the sweet <i>maguey</i> root, ready-cooked,
was offered for sale, and various other things made
from this plant. In another part of the market were
exposed the skins of tigers, lions, jackals, otters, red
deer, wild cats, and of other animals of prey. Some
of the skins were tanned. A particular space was
assigned to the venders of fowls, turkeys, ducks, rabbits,
hares, deer, and dogs; also a space to the fruit-sellers,
pastry-cooks, and tripe-mongers. Not far from
these were exposed all kinds of earthenware, from the
largest jars to the smallest pitchers. Next were the
dealers in honey and honey-cakes, and other sweet-meats.
Next to these were the timber-merchants, furniture-dealers,
with assortments of tables, benches,
cradles, and all kinds of wooden implements, all separately
arranged.... But why should I so minutely
detail every article exposed for sale in this great
market? If I enumerated every thing singly, I should
never get to the end of the list. And yet I have not
mentioned the paper, which in this country is called
<i>amatl</i>, the tubes filled with liquid-amber and tobacco,
the various sweet-scented salves, and similar things, or
the various seeds which were exposed for sale in the
porticoes of this market, or the medicinal herbs.</p>

<p>“In the market-place there were courts of justice,
to which three judges and several constables were appointed,
who inspected the goods exposed for sale. I
had almost forgotten to mention the salt, and those
who made the flint-knives; also the fish, and a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
bread made of the mud or scum collected from the surface
of the lake, and eaten in that form, and which has
a taste similar to that of cheese.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Besides, there were
instruments of brass, copper, and tin; cups and painted
pitchers of wood....</p>

<p>“On our way to the great temple, while passing
through the court-yards adjoining the market, we saw
a number of merchants, who dealt in gold-dust as it
came from the mines, which was exposed for sale in
tubes made of large goose-bones, so thin and white
that the gold shone through them. The value of these
tubes of gold was estimated according to their length
and thickness, and were taken in exchange for so
many mantles, <i>xiquipiles</i><a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> of cacao-nuts,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> slaves, or for
other merchandise.</p>

<p>“On quitting the market, we entered the spacious
court-yards surrounding the chief temple. These appeared
to include more ground than the market-place
at Salamanca, and were inclosed by a double wall constructed
of stone and lime. The yards were paved
with large white flag-stones, extremely smooth, and
where there were none, a brown plaster had been
used. The court-yards were kept so very clean that
there was not the smallest particle of dust or straw to
be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>“Before we ascended the steps of the great temple,
Montezuma, who was sacrificing on the top to his
idols, sent six priests and two of his principal officers
to conduct Cortes up the steps. There were one hundred
and fourteen steps to the summit, and as they
feared that Cortes would experience the same fatigue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
in mounting as Montezuma had, they desired to assist
him by taking hold of his arms. Cortes, however,
would not accept the proffered aid. When we had
reached the summit of the temple, we walked across a
platform where many large stones were lying, on
which those who were doomed for sacrifice were
stretched out. Near these stood a large idol, in the
shape of a dragon, surrounded by various other abominable
figures, with a quantity of fresh blood in front of
it....</p>

<p>“This infernal temple, from its great height, commanded
an extensive view of the surrounding country.
From it we could see the three causeways leading to
the city,—that one from Iztapalapan, by which we had
entered the city four days before; that one from Tlacupa,
along which we took our flight eight months
after, when we were driven out of the city by the new
monarch, Cuitlahuatzin; the third, the one from Tepeaquilla.
We also saw the aqueduct, which extended
from Chapultepec, and supplied the city with fresh
water. We could also distinctly see the bridges across
the openings in the causeways, through which the
waters of the lake ebbed and flowed. The lake was
crowded with canoes conveying provisions, manufactured
articles, and other merchandise to the city.
We also observed that the only means of intercourse
between the houses in this city, and between those of
all the other towns built in the lake, was by draw-bridges
or canoes. In all these cities the beautiful
white-plastered temples rose above the smaller ones,
like many of the towers and castles in our Spanish
cities. The view from the top of the temple, it may be
imagined, was a splendid sight.</p>

<p>“After we had sufficiently gazed upon this magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
picture, we again turned our eyes toward the
great market, and beheld the vast number of buyers
and sellers who thronged it. The bustle and noise
caused by this multitude of human beings was so great
that it could be heard at a distance of more than four
miles. Some of our men, who had been at Constantinople
and at Rome and had travelled through the
whole of Italy, said that they never had seen a market-place
of such large dimensions, or which was so well
regulated, or so crowded with people as this one in
Mexico....</p>

<p>“We were conducted to a small temple with one
room, in which we saw two bases resembling altars,
decked with coverings of extreme beauty. On each of
them stood a gigantic, bulky-looking figure. The one
on the right hand represented the god of war, Huitzilopochtli.
This idol had a very broad face with distorted
and terrible eyes, and was covered with jewels,
gold, and pearls, fastened with a paste made from a
certain root. Large serpents, also, covered with gold
and precious stones, wound round the body of this
monster, which held in one hand a bow, and in the
other a bunch of arrows. Another but smaller idol,
its page, standing by its side carried the monster’s
short spear and golden shield, studded with precious
stones. Around Huitzilopochtli’s neck were figures
representing human faces, and hearts made of gold
and silver and decorated with blue stones. In front
of him stood several perfuming pans containing copal,
the incense of the country; also the hearts of three
Indians, who had been killed that day. The hearts
were consuming before him as a burnt-offering. The
walls of the temple and the whole floor were almost
black with human blood, and the stench was highly
offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“On the left hand stood another figure of the same
size as Huitzilopochtli. Its face resembled very much
that of a bear. Its shining eyes were made of <i>tetzcat</i>,
the reflecting-glass of the country. This idol, like its
brother Huitzilopochtli, was covered with precious
stones, and was called Tetzcatlipuca. This was the god of
hell.... A circle of figures wound round its body,
resembling diminutive devils with serpents’ tails. The
walls and floor around this idol were also besmeared
with blood, and the stench was greater than that of a
Spanish slaughter-house. Five human hearts had that
day been offered to him. On the very top of this
temple stood another; the wood-work of which was
exceedingly elaborate and richly carved. In this temple
there was another idol, half man and half lizard,
completely covered with precious stones; half of this
figure was hidden from view. We were told that the
concealed half was covered with the seeds of every
plant on the earth, for this idol was the god of seeds
and fruits.... In the temple was a drum of
enormous dimensions, the sound of which was so deep
and solemn that it was appropriately called the drum
of hell. The drum-head was made from the skin of
an enormous serpent. The sound of the drum could
be heard eight miles. The platform of the temple was
covered with a variety of hellish objects,—large and
small trumpets, great slaughtering knives, the burnt
hearts of Indians who had been sacrificed,—every
thing being clotted with coagulated blood, terrible to
view and filling the mind with horror....</p>

<p>“If I remember rightly, this temple occupied a
space of ground on which we could have placed six of
the largest buildings commonly found in our country.
The building had the form of a pyramid, on the summit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
of which was the small temple with the idols....</p>

<p>“Cortes and the rest of us at last grew weary with
the inspection of so many idols and the implements
used for sacrifices, and we returned to our quarters accompanied
by a great number of the chief men and
caciques, whom Montezuma had ordered to attend
us.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to follow farther the movements
of the conquerors (<i>conquistadores</i>) of New
Spain. The beautiful and famous metropolis of Mexico,
twenty-two months after Cortes and his followers
had entered it, was in ruins, filled with the innumerable
dead bodies of its heroic defenders. The siege of the
city lasted ninety-three days, ending the 13th of August,
1521. When the terrible drama ended, Cortes
permitted those of its inhabitants who had not been
killed, starved, or stricken with disease, to leave the
charnel city. “The causeways,” says Diaz, “were
crowded for three days and nights with men, women,
and children, on their way to the main-land. These
poor beings were much emaciated, and had a deathlike
appearance.... The houses were found
filled with dead bodies.... The soil in the
city looked as if it had been ploughed, for the famished
inhabitants had dug every root out of the ground, and
had even peeled the bark from the trees to appease
their hunger. We did not find any fresh water in the
city, for that in all the wells was salty. During the
horrible famine the Mexicans had not eaten the flesh
of their countrymen, although they greedily devoured
that of the Tlascallans and Spaniards. Certainly no
people in this world ever suffered so much from hunger,
thirst, and the horrors of war, as the inhabitants
of this great city.” As the emperor’s share of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
booty, Cortes sent to Spain two vessels carrying
eighty-eight thousand <i>pesos</i> of gold in bars, and the
wardrobe of Montezuma. “The latter,” Diaz observes,
“was a valuable present, and well worthy of our great
emperor’s acceptance, for it embraced jewels of the greatest
value, pearls of the size of hazel-nuts, and various
precious stones, the number of which my memory will
not permit me to designate. At the same time were
sent the bones of the giants which we found in the
temple of Cojohuacan, which were similar to those
given to us by the Tlascallans that we had previously
sent to Spain.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That part of the coast of the continent, now included
in the territory of the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and the westerly portion of
Florida, was first discovered and explored by Alonso
Alvarez de Pineda. The fleet which this Spaniard
commanded was fitted out by Francisco de Garay, the
wealthy governor of the island of Jamaica, who had
accompanied Columbus to the New World in 1493.
Bernal Diaz, in his history of the conquest of New
Spain, thus speaks of this expedition: “In the year
1518, when the report of our having discovered this
country, under Cordoba and Grijalva, and of the twenty
thousand <i>pesos</i> which came into the hands of Diego
Velasquez, had spread through the whole of the West
Indies,” and when Garay “received information of a
new expedition that was destined for New Spain, under
Hernando Cortes, he [Francisco de Garay] was seized
with a great desire likewise to discover some new
countries, and certainly he had more wealth at his
command than we to fit out a fleet for such a purpose.
He had learned considerable about the riches of the
new countries from our old chief pilot Alaminos, and
how thickly populated the provinces were on the river
Panuco; and as several other sailors, who had accompanied
us on those expeditions, confirmed what Alaminos
had told him, he thought that it was to his advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
to request his majesty to grant him the permission
to make further discoveries on the river
Panuco, and to appoint him governor of all the lands
he should discover. For this purpose he dispatched
his major-domo, Juan de Torralva, to Spain, with letters
and presents for those who at that time administered
the affairs of the Indies, soliciting them to procure him
the appointment mentioned.</p>

<p>“His majesty was at the time in Flanders, and the
president of the council of the Indies, Don Juan
Rodriguez de Fonseca, bishop of Burgos and titular
archbishop of Rosano, with the two licentiates Zapata
and Vargas, and the secretary Lopez de Conchillos,
managed the affairs of the Indies as they pleased.
Garay therefore easily obtained the appointment of
adelantado and governor of the provinces bordering
on the river San Pedro and San Pablo, and of all
the countries he should discover. By virtue of this
appointment he fitted out three vessels, having on
board two hundred and forty men, including a strong
body of cavalry, cross-bowmen, and musketeers. The
chief command of this fleet he gave to Alonso Alvarez
de Pineda.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>”</p>

<p>It is further related that the explorers set sail in
1519, toward “the peninsula of Florida, in twenty-five
degrees of north latitude, for Florida appeared to them
to be a very attractive island, and they thought that it
was better to settle on islands than on the main-land,
because they could more easily conquer the natives
and keep them in subjection. They landed, but the
people of Florida killed so many of them that they did
not dare to settle there. They then sailed along the
coast and came to the river of Panuco, five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
leagues from the peninsula of Florida, measured on a
course along the coast. The natives attacked them
at every place. Many of them were killed at Chila
[near the mouth of the river Panuco], where the natives
flayed and eat those who fell into their hands, and hung
up the skins in their temples to commemorate their
valor.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Diaz further observes: “While we were lying at
Villa Segura, Cortes was informed by letters that one
of the vessels which Garay had fitted out for the purpose
of forming settlements on the river Panuco had
arrived at Vera Cruz. This vessel was commanded
by a certain Comargo, and had on board more than
sixty soldiers, who were all in bad health, with their
bodies greatly swelled. This Comargo gave the particulars
of the unfortunate termination of Garay’s expedition
to the river Panuco.</p>

<p>“The Indians had massacred the commander-in-chief,
Alonso Alvarez de Pineda, and all his soldiers
and horses, and then had set fire to his vessels. Comargo
alone had been fortunate enough to escape
with his men on board of one of the vessels, and
had steered for Vera Cruz, where the explorers arrived
half famished, for they had not been able to
procure any provisions from the enemy. This Comargo,
it was said, had taken the vows of the order
of the Dominicans.</p>

<p>“Comargo and his men, by moderate advances,
at last arrived at Villa Segura, for they were so
weakened that they could scarcely move along. When
Cortes saw in what a terrible condition they were,
he commended them to our care, and showed Comargo
and all his men every possible kindness. If I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
remember rightly, Comargo died soon after, and also
several of his men.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The fields of the explorations of Alonso Alvarez
de Pineda, Juan de Grijalva, Francisco Hernandez de
Cordoba, and Juan Ponce de Leon are represented on
a traced map of the coast of the continent and of the
new lands (<i>traza de las costas de tierra-firme y de las
tierras nuevas</i>), made in 1521, to define the limits of
the jurisdictions of Juan Ponce Leon, Francisco de
Garay, and Diego Velasquez.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>On the peninsula of Florida, delineated on the map,
is inscribed in Spanish: “Florida called Bimini, which
Juan Ponce discovered.” West of it is a broken line
and this inscription: “As far as this Juan Ponce discovered.”
At some distance farther west is another
line of limitation and this explanation: “From here
Francisco Garay began to discover.” West of this is
the early designation of the Mississippi River, “Rio del
Espiritu Santo” (River of the Holy Spirit). Southward
beyond the mouth of the Panuco River is a third
broken line and the inscription: “As far as this
place Francisco de Garay discovered toward the west,
and Diego Velazquez toward the east as far as Cabo
de las Higueras, which the Pinzons discovered, and the
population has given it to them.”</p>

</div>

<p>According to these <i>memoranda</i> and the statements
of Herrera, the Spanish historian, Juan Ponce de Leon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
explored the eastern coast of Florida from La Cruz,
south of the thirty-first parallel, to a point on the southwestern
coast, perhaps as far as Appalachee Bay.
Alonso Alvarez de Pineda’s explorations, it would seem,
began at Appalachicola Bay and ended at the Panuco
River.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>The more northerly part of the eastern coast of
Florida and coast of the present state of Georgia were
inspected by the officers and crews of two vessels,
equipped in 1520 in the port of La Plata, San Domingo,
by seven citizens of that island. The ships
were fitted out to sail among the Bahama Islands to
kidnap Indians to work in the mines and on the plantations.
Among the projectors of the expedition was
Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> When the kidnapers
arrived among the Bahama Islands they found them
depopulated. “They determined,” it is said, “to go
farther toward the north to search for a new country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
rather than return without any slaves. They reached
a country called Chicora and Gualdape, in thirty-two
degrees of north latitude”; where there was a cape,
afterward called Cabo de Santa Elena (Cape of Saint
Helen), and the Rio Jordan (River Jordan).<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>“When our men steered toward the shore,” Peter
Martyr relates, “the inhabitants, astonished at the
sight of the ships, imagined that some monster was
approaching. In order to satisfy their curiosity they
flocked in great numbers to the shore. When our
people were about to land with their boats the Indians
ran rapidly away. As they fled our men pursued.
Some of the youngest and the fastest runners overtook
two of the natives, a man and a woman. They brought
these to the ships, dressed them, and gave them their
liberty. Impressed by this evidence of good-will the
Indians returned in crowds to the beach. The king of
the country, learning how our men had dealt with the
man and the woman, and seeing the new and costly
garments upon them (for the Indians only clothe themselves
with the skins of lions or of other animals), sent
fifty of his people to ours bearing the productions of
the country. When visited by our people he was
friendly and hospitable. When they expressed a
desire to see the surrounding country he gave them
guides and guards. Wherever they went the inhabitants
came reverently to them with presents as unto
gods to be adored, especially when they saw them
having beards, and clothed with linen and silken garments.
But what! The Spaniards violated the laws
of hospitality. For by craft and various cunning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
devices, after they had seen all that they wished, they
so managed that on an appointed day the Indians
visited the ships to inspect them. When the vessels
were crowded with these innocent people, the anchors
were weighed and the sails hoisted, and the Indians
were carried away mourning into servitude. Instead
of friends, they made the people of those regions
enemies, and having found them contented they left
them miserable, having taken children from parents,
and husbands from wives. Of the two ships one only
returned, the other was never seen again. It was conjectured
that all on board were drowned, the guilty
and the guiltless, for it was an old ship....</p>

<p>“While they were there they explored the two
principal regions, Chicora and Duharhe....
They say that the people of Chicora are half black or
tawny as our farmers are, burned and tanned by the
sun. The men allow their hair to grow long, which
often extends down to their girdles. The hair of the
women is much longer. Both sexes bind up their
hair. The men have no beards. Whether or not they
are so naturally or so by art is unknown; however,
they take great pride in having smooth faces....
Leaving Chicora they went to the other side of the
bay, and took possession of the region called Duharhe.”</p>

<p>Peter Martyr further observes that Ayllon had been
a persistent solicitor at the court of Spain, and that he
wanted to obtain letters-patent to go again to these
countries “to plant a colony there.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> ... He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
brought one of the natives of Chicora with him....
While he remained [in Spain] prosecuting his business,
I sometimes had Ayllon, the master, and the Chicoran,
his servant, as my guests. The Chicoran is not a dull
person nor superficially intelligent. He has learned
the Spanish language passably well. The things
which Ayllon showed me, written by his men and reported
by the Chicoran, that are strange and remarkable,
I will relate.... Ayllon says the natives
there [in Duharhe] are white, which also Franciscus,
the tawny Chicoran, asserts, and that they have long
yellow hair hanging down to their ankles.</p>

<p>“These people have a king of giant-like proportions,
called Datha, and they say that the queen, his wife, is
not much smaller.... This king being asked
why he and his wife were so remarkably tall and the
other people not, replied that their height was not
hereditary, but that it had been caused by violent
treatment. While they were infants in the charge of
nurses their parents sent for those practicing the art,
who anointed their limbs for a number of days with
certain decoctions of herbs to soften their tender
bones, which in time became as pliable as lukewarm
wax. They then stretched their limbs, often leaving
them almost dead. Thereupon the nurses, who had
been fed with certain strength-producing meats, suckled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
them, the infants being covered with warm cloths.
When they had again regained their vigor the practitioners
again twisted and pulled their bones as they
had previously done. This treatment was repeated
from time to time until their limbs were lengthened so
much that when they reached maturity they had the
desired tallness....</p>

<p>“There is another region near Duharhe called Xapida.
In it they say pearls and a precious stone resembling
a pearl are to be found, which the natives
highly prize. In all the country explored by them
there were herds of deer kept like cattle with us. The
deer fawn at home, and there they also rear their
young. These deer, when free, wander and pasture in
the woods during the day and at night return to their
young. They are confined in pens and allow themselves
to be milked.... The people fatten many
kinds of fowl, as chickens, ducks, geese, and the like.
Their bread is maize, the same as that of the people of
the islands.... The grain of the maize is like our
panic of Insubria, [in Italy,] but in size like pease.
They sow another kind of corn called Xathi. They
believe it is millet.... The natives have several
varieties of potatoes, but they are small.... The
Spaniards speak of many regions which they think are
under the government of one and the same king,—Hitha,
Xamunabe, Tihe.</p>

<p>“In this country they say there is a caste of priests
differing from the people. These priests are held in
great reverence by the inhabitants of the surrounding
country. The natives of this region cut their hair,
leaving only two curled locks hanging down in front of
their ears, which locks they tie under their chins. The
Spaniards explored many regions of this great country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
which tracts they called Arambe, Guacaia, Quohathe,
Tanzacca, Pahor. The inhabitants are all somewhat
tawny and swart. None of them have any knowledge
of letters, but they possess many traditions which they
preserve and relate in rhymes and songs. They exercise
themselves in dancing and skipping, and find much
amusement in playing ball, for they are very nimble
and skillful. The women sew and spin, and although
for the most part they are dressed in the skins of wild
animals, they have cotton and make thread from the
fibres of certain tough plants, as our hemp or flax.
There is another region called Inzignanin.”<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>According to Gomara’s geographical description
of the coast of North America, the explorations of the
Spaniards who discovered Tierra de Ayllon (the Land
of Ayllon) extended from the Cape of St. Helen, in 32°,
northwardly forty leagues to the River Jordan. If Cape
St. Helen were a point of land near the mouth of the
Combahee River, the river Jordan was likely the Santee
River, in South Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Among the most renowned of the various maritime
achievements which gave great fame to Spanish enterprise
in seeking for a sea-path to Cathay by sailing
toward the west, was that of the circumnavigation
of the globe in the years 1519-1522. The remarkable
voyage was begun by Fernam de Magalhaens, a
Portuguese navigator. The first account of the expedition
was written by Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian
chevalier, who accompanied Magalhaens. Pigafetta’s
connection with the exploration is explained by him in
the opening chapter of his history of the voyage: “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
learned that a squadron of five vessels were under
equipment at Seville, destined for the discovery of the
Molucca Islands from which we get our spices, and
that Fernam de Magalhaens,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> a Portuguese gentleman,
and a commander of the order of St. Iago de la
Spata, who had already more than once traversed the
ocean with great reputation, was made captain-general
of the expedition.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Therefore I immediately repaired
to Barcelona to request permission of his majesty to be
one of the number of persons to go on this voyage.
My request was granted.”</p>

<p>The interested historian then relates: “The
captain-general, Fernam de Magalhaens, had determined
to undertake a long voyage across the ocean
where the winds are violent and storms quite frequent.
He also resolved to take a course not yet explored by
any navigator, but this bold purpose he was cautious
in disclosing lest some one should try to dissuade him
from it by magnifying the risk he would run and thus
dishearten his men. Besides the dangers common to a
voyage like this one was the disadvantageous circumstance
that the four other vessels under his
command were in charge of captains inimical to him
solely because he was a Portuguese and they were
Spaniards.”</p>

<p>The fleet sailed from the port of Seville, on Monday
morning, the tenth of August, 1519. The five
ships proceeded southwardly along the coast of Africa,
passed between Cape Verd and the islands of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Cape Verd group, and after reaching Sierra Leone,
stood for the coast of Brazil.</p>

<p>“After we crossed the equator,” says Pigafetta,
“we lost sight of the north star. We then steered
south-southwest, making for Terra del Verzino (Land
of Red wood), in latitude twenty-three degrees thirty
minutes south latitude.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> This country is a continuation
of that in which Cape St. Augustine is situated,
in eight degrees thirty minutes south latitude.”</p>

<p>The squadron entered the port now known as that
of Rio Janeiro on St. Lucy’s day, the thirteenth of
December.</p>

<p>“The land of Brazil, which produces every thing in
abundance, is as large as Spain, France, and Italy
united. It is one of the countries acquired by the
king of Portugal. The people of Brazil are not
Christians, nor are they idolaters, for they worship
nothing.... They go entirely naked, the
women as well as the men. Their houses are long
cabins, which they call <i>boi</i>. They lie on cotton-nets
called hammocks fastened at the ends to two strong
posts. Their fire-places are on the ground. Their
<i>bois</i> frequently contain a hundred men, with their
wives and children, consequently there is always considerable
noise in these houses....</p>

<p>“The people of Brazil, both men and women, paint
their bodies and particularly their faces in a singular
manner with different figures. They have short,
woolly hair on their heads, but none on other parts of
their bodies, for they pluck it out. They have a dress
made of the interwoven feathers of the parrot, and so
arranged that the large quills of the wings and tail
form a girdle about their loins, giving the wearer a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
unique and grotesque appearance. Almost all the
men have their lower lips pierced with three holes,
through which they thrust a slender cylindrical stone
about two inches long. The women and children do
not wear this cumbersome ornament.... Their
color is more of an olive than a black.”</p>

</div>

<p>After anchoring thirteen days in the port of Rio
Janeiro, the fleet coasted southward to the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata, where, as Pigafetta relates: “Juan
de Solis, while on a similar voyage of discovery, was
with sixty of his crew devoured by cannibals, in whom
they placed too much confidence.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of winter, in the month of May,
1520, the fleet reached the port of St. Julian, “in forty-nine
degrees thirty minutes,” where they anchored for
five months.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Here the explorers were visited by a
number of giants. Pigafetta, describing one of the
visitors, remarks: “This man was so prodigiously
large that our heads scarcely reached to his waist.
He had an attractive appearance. His face was broad
and painted red, with the exception of a circle of
yellow round his eyes and two spots, figured like
hearts, on his cheeks. His hair, which was thin, was
whitened with some kind of a powder. His coat, or
rather his mantle, was made of furs, well sewed together,
taken from an indigenous animal, which afterward
we had an opportunity to see. This animal [the
guanaco] has the head and ears of a mule, the body of
a camel, the legs of a stag, and the tail of a horse, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
like the latter, neighs. This man also wore shoes
made of the skin of the same animal. In his left hand
he carried a short and heavy bow; the string, somewhat
thicker than a lute’s, was made of an intestine of
the animal already mentioned. In his other hand he
held arrows made of short reeds, with feathers at one
end, similar to our arrows, and at the other, instead of
iron, a white and black flint....</p>

<p>“The women are not as tall as the men, but they
are much stouter.... They paint and dress in
the same manner as their husbands, and use the thin
skin of an animal to cover their nakedness. They
were, in our judgment, far from handsome, nevertheless
their husbands seemed jealous....</p>

<p>“Savage as these Indians are, they are not without
their medicaments. When they have a pain in the
stomach, in place of an active medicine they thrust an
arrow far down the throat to cause them to vomit....
If they have the headache, they make a
gash in their forehead, and do the same with other
parts of their body where they suffer pain, to draw
from the affected part a considerable quantity of
blood....</p>

<p>“Their hair is cut circularly, like that of monks, but
it is longer, and they confine it round the head with a
cotton-string, in which bandage they place their arrows
when they go hunting.... It appears that
their religion is limited to adoring the devil. They
pretend that when one of them is on the point of
death, ten or twelve demons appear dancing and singing
around the dying person.... These people,
as I have already said, clothe themselves with the
skin of an animal, and also cover their huts with the
same kind of skin. They transport their huts, for they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
have no fixed place of abode, and wander about
from place to place like gypsies. They live on
raw meat and a sweet root called <i>capac</i>....
Our captain gave these people the name of Patagonians....</p>

<p>“Scarcely had we anchored in this roadstead before
the four captains of the other vessels plotted to murder
the captain-general. These traitors were Juan of
Carthagena, inspector of the fleet, Luis de Mendoza,
the treasurer, Antonio Cocca, the paymaster, and
Gaspar de Casada. The plot was discovered. The
first named was flayed alive, and the second stabbed
to the heart. Gaspar de Casada was forgiven, but in
a few days he was again treacherous. Then the captain-general
(who did not dare to take Casada’s life, as he
was made a captain by the emperor,) drove him from
the fleet and left him in the country of the Patagonians,
with a priest, his accomplice....</p>

<p>“We planted a cross on the summit of a neighboring
mountain, which we named Monte Cristo, and took
possession of the country in the name of the king of
Spain....</p>

<p>“Continuing our course toward the south, on the
twenty-first of October, in fifty-two degrees, we discovered
a strait, which we called the Strait of the
Eleven Thousand Virgins (xi. mila Vergini), in honor
of the day. This strait, as it will hereafter appear, is
four hundred and forty miles, or one hundred and ten
leagues long, and about a half league wide, more or
less.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> It extends to another sea, which we named the
Pacific Ocean (Mar pacifico). The strait lies between
lofty mountains covered with snow, and the channel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
was so deep that we were compelled to anchor close
to the shore.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> ...</p>

<p>“The whole of the crew were so fully persuaded
that this strait had no western outlet, that we should
have left it unexplored had it not been for the profound
scientific knowledge of the captain-general. Skillful
as he was intrepid, he knew that he had to sail through
a very secluded strait which he had seen marked on a
chart, in the archives of the king of Portugal, drawn
by that most excellent man, Martin of Boemia.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>“As soon as we entered the strait, imagined to be
only a bay, the captain sent the two ships, the San
Antonio and La Concepcion, in advance to explore it
to its termination or to where it extended, while we,
in the ships La Trinidad and La Victoria, remained at
its mouth.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>“Two days passed before the vessels returned that
had been sent to examine the bottom of the bay. We
began to conjecture that they had been engulfed during
the tempest which had occurred, for seeing smoke
on shore we imagined that those who had the good
fortune to escape had kindled fires to inform us of their
existence and distress. But while in this painful suspense
we saw the ships coming toward us under full
sail and with their flags flying.... When we
learned from those on board that they had seen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
prolongation of the bay, or, more correctly, of the
strait, we sailed to them to continue our voyage on
this course, if possible.</p>

<p>“When we had entered into the third bay, which I
have already mentioned, we saw two openings, or
channels, the one running to the southeast, the other
to the southwest.... The captain-general sent
the two vessels, the San Antonio and La Concepcion,
to the southeast to examine whether or not this channel
terminated in an open sea. The first set sail immediately
under press of canvas, not choosing to wait
for the second, which the pilot wished to leave behind,
for he had intended to avail himself of the darkness of
the night to retrace his course and return to Spain by
the same way he had come.</p>

<p>“This pilot was Estevan Gomez, who hated Magalhaens,
for the sole reason that when Magalhaens came
to Spain to lay his project before the emperor of going
to the Moluccas by a western route, Gomez himself
had already requested, and was on the point of
obtaining, some caravels for an expedition of which he
would have had the command. This expedition had
for its object new discoveries, but the arrival of Magalhaens
prevented his request from being granted, and
he only obtained the subaltern position of pilot. His
disaffection was further increased by the thought of his
serving under a Portugese. In the course of the night
he conspired with the other Spaniards on board the
ship. They put in irons and even wounded the captain,
Alvaro de Meschita, the cousin-german of the
captain-general, and carried him to Spain.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>When the strait was explored to its termination,
the cape where the strait ended was called, says Pigafetta,
“Il Cabo Deseado” (The Desired Cape).</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the twenty-eighth of November,
1520, the three ships left the strait and entered the
unexplored expanse of the Pacific. “In the course of
three months and twenty days,” Pigafetta observes,
“we traversed nearly four thousand leagues on the
ocean called by us the Pacific, on account of our not
having experienced during this period any tempestuous
weather. In this long space of time we did not
descry any land, except two desert islands. On these
we saw nothing but birds and trees, therefore we
named them, Isole Sfortunato<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> (The Unfortunate
Islands).... The two islands are two hundred
leagues apart. The first lies in fifteen degrees south
latitude, the second in nine degrees. According to the
measure which we made of the voyage with the chain
at the poop, we ran daily about sixty to seventy
leagues.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> If God and the Holy Mother had not
granted us a fortunate voyage we should all have
perished from hunger on so vast a sea. I do not think
that any one will hereafter venture on a similar voyage.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>“If we had continued on a western course on the
same parallel after leaving the strait we should have
circumnavigated the globe without seeing any land
except that extending from the Cape of the Eleven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
Thousand Virgins, at the eastern head of the strait, in
the Ocean Sea (Mar oceano), to Cabo Deseado, at
the western end, in the Pacific Sea (Mar pacifico).
The two capes are in fifty-two degrees south latitude.</p>

<p>“The antarctic pole has not as many stars as the
arctic. At the former a large number of small stars
cluster together which form two <i>nebulæ</i>. They are
separated from each other and are somewhat dim. In
these <i>nebulæ</i> are two large and brilliant stars which
move very little. These indicate the antarctic pole.
Although the needle declined somewhat from the arctic
pole it still oscillated toward it, but not with the same
force as when in the northern hemisphere. When the
captain-general out at sea directed the course in which
the pilots should steer, he asked them in what direction
they steered. All of them replied that they bore in
the direction in which he had ordered them. He then
informed them that their course was wrong and directed
them to correct the needle, because, as they
were in the southern hemisphere, it had not the same
power to designate the true north as in the northern
hemisphere. When we got out in the open sea, we
saw, in the west, a cross of five very bright stars.</p>

<p>“We steered northwest by west till we reached the
equator in one hundred and twenty-two degrees of
longitude, west of the line of demarkation....
After we crossed the equator we steered west by north.
We then ran two hundred leagues toward the west,
when, changing our course again, we ran west by
south until we reached thirteen degrees of north latitude.
We proposed by this course to reach Cape
Catticara which geographers have placed in this latitude,
but they are mistaken, for this cape lies twelve
degrees more toward the north.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>From the islands, which Magalhaens called “Isole de
Ladroni,”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> the three ships stood toward the Philippine
Islands, where, on one called Matan, the captain-general
was killed in an engagement with the natives, on
the twenty-seventh of April, 1521. It was at the
island of Zubu, near the former, “in ten degrees north
latitude,” that Magalhaens, before his death, received
the first intelligence respecting the Molucca Islands.
On Wednesday, the sixth of November, 1521, the
ships came in sight of the long-sought Spice Islands,
and on Friday, the eighth of November, 1521, the
Victoria and the Trinidad arrived at the island of Tadore.
“We now,” Pigafetta remarks, “returned
thanks to God and manifested our joy by firing a
round from all of our large guns. It will not excite astonishment
that we should be elated, when it is considered
that we had been at sea twenty-seven months,
wanting two days, and had visited numerous islands in
search of those we had reached.</p>

<p>“The Portuguese had reported that the Molucca
Islands lay in the middle of an impassable sea, full of
shallows, and were surrounded by a cloudy, foggy atmosphere.
We, however, found the contrary, and
never had less than a hundred fathoms water all the
way to the Molucca Islands.” The latter were five in
number: Tarenate, Tadore, Mutir, Machian and
Bachian.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> When afterward cloves were found on the
adjacent islands, the name Moluccas, was applied to all
the islands lying between the Philippines and Java.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>After a short sojourn at the Spice Islands, the return
voyage was made by the ship La Victoria alone, commanded
by Juan Sebastian del Cano,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> who set sail from
Tadore on the twenty-first of December, 1521, the
ship La Concepcion having been burned at the island
Bohol, and La Trinidad having been left at the Moluccas
in a leaking condition. Following the route along
the coast of Africa, the ship La Victoria arrived at
Seville, on Monday, the eighth of September, 1522, she
having sailed in the entire voyage, according to Pigafetta’s
computation, fourteen thousand six hundred
leagues. Thus passed into history the wonderful
achievement of the first circumnavigation of the earth
in three years and twenty-nine days.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The signal success of the maritime enterprise of the
Spaniards engendered a spirit of jealousy among the
Portuguese. The feeling of being overshadowed by
their persistent rival in reaching the Indies by the way
of the West led them to accuse the Spaniards of encroaching
on their commercial route to the Spice
Islands, and of breaking the treaty of Tordesillas.
The Spaniards in defence claimed that the Moluccas
or the Spice Islands, found by Magellan’s companions,
were not within the limits of the territory of the Portuguese
as defined by the papal bull.</p>

<p>To settle these national differences the notable congress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
of Badajos was convened in the spring of 1524.
The king of each country sent to it special commissioners,
among which number were Fernando Columbus,
Sebastian Cabot, Diego Ribero, and Estevan
Gomez. For a number of days the two parties angrily
disputed concerning the indefinite position of the line
of demarkation as established by the treaty of Tordesillas
in 1494. It was a question not easily decided
where among the Cape Verd Islands the point was,
through which, at the distance of three hundred and
seventy leagues from it, the line of limitation passed to
the poles, for the group of the Cape Verd Islands occupies
a space in extent from east to west of about one
hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>Wherever, east or west, they decided this point
should be established each party was aware that so
much space would be gained or lost on the opposite
side of the earth by the one or the other of the two
countries. The congress, after many exciting disputations,
finally ended its session on the last day of May,
without reaching any decision respecting the position
of the papal line of limitation. The admission that
Spain had full title to the Spice or Molucca Islands and
that Portugal had acquired the right of possession of a
part of Brazil, were the chief concessions made by this
contentious body of learned men.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The competitive zeal which Portugal, Spain, and
England had displayed, in searching for a short water-way
to the eastern coast of Asia, in time quickened
the ambition of France to emulate these maritime
powers in discovering a desirable route across the
Atlantic to the vast domains of the Grand Khan of
Cathay. The Gulf of St. Lawrence, as early as the
year 1504, was frequented by the fishing vessels of
France. The exploration of the coast of the New
Land, north of the present Atlantic territory of the
United States of America, is described by a famous
French sea-captain of Dieppe, in 1539.</p>

<p>“The said land, that part running east and west
[Cape Breton Island and Nova Scotia?], was discovered
about thirty-five years ago by the Bretons
[Britons?] and Normans; hence this land has been
called the Cape of the Bretons [Britons?].</p>

<p>“The other part [Newfoundland?] running north
and south from Cape Ras to Cape Buona Vista, including
nearly seventy leagues, was discovered by the
Portuguese, and the remainder, as far as the Gulf of
Castiles [north of the Strait of Belle Isle], and still
farther, was discovered by the said Bretons [Britons?]
and Normans.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“About thirty-three years ago, a ship of Honfleur
first went there, of which vessel Jean Denis was captain,
and Gamart, of Rouen, pilot. In the year 1508,
a ship of Dieppe, called La Pensée, owned by Jean
Ango, father of the captain and viscount of Dieppe,
sailed there, the master or patron of the said ship
being Thomas Aubert, and he was the first person
who brought here people from that country.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>In company with the Pensée, another ship, commanded
by Giovanni da Verrazzano, also sailed from
the port of Dieppe. The two entering the river of St.
Lawrence, ascended it to the distance of eighty leagues.
The exploration of the river is thus described: “The
people of Dieppe continued their commercial intercourse
with the East Indies. When they heard of the
discoveries which the Spaniards had made in America,
they found their emulation incited, and they equipped
two vessels to discover whether that part of the world
did not extend its coast to the north. They intrusted
the command of the ships to two of their most skillful
captains, named Thomas Aubert and Jean Vérassen.
These two ships sailed from Dieppe at the beginning
of the year 1508, and discovered the same year the
St. Lawrence River, to which they gave the name of
Saint Lawrence because they began to ascend it on
this saint’s day [the tenth of August]. They explored
the river for more than eighty leagues, finding the
inhabitants friendly, with whom they made very profitable
exchanges for peltries.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>As related in the chronicle of Eusebius, printed at
Paris in 1512, it appears that Aubert and Verrazzano,
on their departure from the New Land, carried to
France a number of natives. Under the date of 1509,
it is said: “Seven wild men were brought from that
island (which is called the New Land) to Rouen with
their canoe, clothing, and weapons. They are of a
sooty color, with thick lips, and bearing marks on the
face drawn like blue veins along the cheek-bones from
the ear to the middle of the chin; with black hair and
coarse like a horse’s mane; having no beard throughout
the whole life; no hair on any part of the body,
except on the head and eyebrows. They wear a
girdle to cover their nakedness, in which girdle is a
sort of pouch; they form a dialect with their lips;
religion they have none. Their canoe is bark, which
a man can lift on his shoulders with one hand. Their
weapons are large bows, the strings being intestines
or sinews of animals; their arrows are canes barbed
with flint or fish-bone. Their food is boiled flesh;
their drink water. Of bread and wine and money
they have not the least use. They go naked or clad
in the skins of beasts,—bears, deer, sea-calves, and the
like. Their country, parallel to the seventh climate,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
is nearer the West<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> than France is farther from it.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>Although for a number of years, at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, this part of North America
was visited by English, French, and Portuguese seamen,
it appears that no navigator had yet sailed along
the peculiarly marked and sinuous coast of the new
continent between the thirty-fourth and the forty-fifth
parallels of north latitude. Fortunately for France,
Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine, who, in 1508,
had sailed with Aubert to the New Land, was sent a
second time on a voyage of discovery toward the
west.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> As pertinently said by Asher: “What Cadamosta
had done for Portugal, Columbus for Spain,
John Cabot for England, that Verrazzano did for
France.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The history of Verazzano’s second visit to America
rightly begins with the attempt of the king of Portugal,
in 1523, to impede the sailing of the vessels preparing
for the voyage. The means which King John III. of
Portugal employed to frustrate this undertaking are
partly described by D’Andrada, the Portuguese historian.
He says: “At that time the king was told by
some Portuguese doing business in France that one
João Varezano [Giovanni da Varrazzano], a Florentine,
offered himself to Francis to discover other kingdoms
in the East, which the Portuguese had not found, and
that in the ports of Normandy a fleet was making
ready, under the patronage of the admirals of the coast
and the dissimulation of Francis, to plant a colony in
Santa Cruz, called Brazil, discovered and laid down by
the Portuguese on the second voyage to India.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Accordingly,
he [King John III.] sent to France an embassador,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
João da Silveyra, son of Fernão da Silveyra,
who delayed his going no longer than was necessary
to get ready.”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>On his arrival at the court of France, Silveyra
pursued his investigations respecting the expedition,
and on the twenty-fifth of April, 1523, wrote to King
John III., saying:</p>

<p>“By what I hear Master João Verazano, who is
going on the discovery of Cathay, has not left up to
this date for want of opportunity, and because of differences,
I understand, between himself and men; and
on this point, although knowing nothing positively, I
have written my doubts in accompanying letters. I
shall continue to doubt, unless he take his departure.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Silveyra, according to what is said by D’Andrada,
“accomplished nothing he had in hand except to delay
the voyage of the Florentine.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the secret machinations of the
king of Portugal, four vessels were finally fitted out
and placed under the command of Verrazzano, “to
discover new lands.” Late in the year 1523, the fleet
set sail, but having encountered a severe storm in the
North Sea, all the ships were disabled, and Verrazzano,
having returned to Brittany to repair the two barques,
La Normandie and La Dauphine, afterward sailed
in the Dauphine to the New Land.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>When he returned to France, he wrote an interesting
letter to Francis I., king of France, dated “on
board the ship La Dauphine, in the port of Dieppe, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Normandy, July 8, 1524.”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> In this communication Verrazzano
relates what had happened to his fleet in the
North Sea, how he had carried out the orders of the
king by sailing in the Dauphine toward the west to go
to Cathay, where and when he discovered a new land
never before seen by men of ancient or modern times.
He then describes the people inhabiting the country,
speaks of its various productions, mentions the peculiar
physical features of its coast, tells how many leagues he
had sailed along it, and concludes with a brief review
of the discoveries made to the year 1524 in the western
hemisphere. His remarks concerning his failure
to find a convenient harbor where he first descried
land, of his unsuccessful search for one south of the
thirty-fourth parallel, of his steering afterward toward
the north in quest of a haven, and of his disappointment
in this direction, are so applicable to the peculiar
features of this part of the eastern coast of the United
States, that it is easy to perceive that he faithfully pictures
the shores of South Carolina and North Carolina,
along which he began his explorations. The comparisons
he makes respecting the natives, the flora, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
fauna, the climate, and the harbors of the more northern
part of the coast, prove that he had travelled extensively
in other parts of the world, and that he was
well informed concerning the things he commented
upon in his letter. His geographical knowledge is
far in advance of that of the scientific men of his time,
and he constantly shows that he was practically acquainted
with all the known means which were then
used to ascertain longitude, latitude, and the measurement
of distances. His opinion that the Orient extended
around to the New Land was well founded,
since it was not known until the eighteenth century
that Behring’s Strait separated America from Asia.
His reasoning concerning the dimensions of the new
continent, that if its breadth corresponded to the extent
of its sea-coast it doubtless exceeded Asia in size, is
logically correct. Verrazzano’s hopefulness that information
of a more satisfactory character respecting the
extent of the territory of the New Land would be obtained
by other explorers, shows that he was less
thoughtful of the brilliancy of his own achievements
than he was of the more desirable and important results
of future voyages to that part of the present coast
of the United States, between the thirty-fourth and
forty-fifth parallels, of which he is rightfully entitled to
be regarded the discoverer. Verrazzano wrote:<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Most Serene Sire:</p>

<p>“After the past fortune on the northern coasts I
did not write to your most serene and Christian
majesty concerning the success of the four vessels
ordered to the ocean to discover new lands, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
that you would be informed of all: how, by the impetuous
stress of the winds, we were compelled, with
only the ships La Normandie and La Dauphine, in a
damaged condition, to put back to Brittany, where
they were mended. Your serene majesty has heard
of the wandering course we made with these, armed
as in war, along the shores of Spain, and afterward of
the new purpose to pursue, with the Dauphine alone,
the first voyage, from which having returned, I will
give your serene majesty an account of what we discovered.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>“From the desert-rock<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> in the sea, near the island
of Madeira of the most serene king of Portugal, we
departed with the said Dauphine, on the seventeenth
of the past month of January, with fifty men, furnished
with provisions, arms, and other martial instruments,
and naval stores for eight months. Sailing westwardly,
an easterly wind blowing pleasantly and moderately,
we ran in twenty-five days 800 leagues.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> On the
fourteenth of February (<i>il di 14 Febbrajo</i>), we encountered
a storm as severe as any one navigating
ever experienced, from which we were enabled
with divine help and goodness to escape, to the
praise of the glorious and fortunate name of the
ship, which endured the violent waves of the sea, and
we pursued our voyage, continuing toward the west,
holding a little to the north. In twenty-five more days
(<i>in venti cinque altri giorni</i>), we ran 400 other leagues,
when there appeared a new land, never before seen by
men in ancient or modern times.</p>

<p>“At first it seemed to be somewhat low. On approaching
it within a quarter of a league, we saw by
the large fires made on the shore that it was inhabited.
We observed that the coast trended toward the south,
and we inspected it to discover some harbor which we
might enter with the ship to examine the nature of the
land, but for fifty leagues along it we could not find a
convenient haven where we could safely stay. Seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
the coast continued to run toward the south, we determined
to turn and go back to the north, where we
found the same want of harbors as we ascended the
coast.”</p>

<p class="caption">A copy of a part of the map of the fourth part of the
world in the French work, “La Cosmographie Universelle,” by André Thevet,
printed in Paris in 1575. (The original part is about one-third larger.)</p>
</div>

<p>The New Land (<i>Nuova Terra</i>), discovered by Verrazzano,
was first seen by him on the tenth of March,
(<i>old style</i>,) being that part of the coast of the continent
now included in the present territory of North
Carolina, north of Cape Fear,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> on the thirty-fourth parallel
of north latitude. It appears that Verrazzano had
thought of finding land on his way to the Indies, for
he says: “My intention in this voyage was to reach
Cathay, on the extreme coast of Asia, expecting, however,
to find in the newly discovered land some such
obstacle as I found.”</p>

<p>“Ordering a boat to carry us ashore, we beheld,”
says Verrazzano, “many people who had collected on
the beach. Seeing us approaching, they fled. Some,
however, turned and gazed at us with much curiosity.
Assuring them by various signs, a number came near,
manifesting great delight in scrutinizing the peculiarities
of our clothing, figure, and whiteness. They indicated
by signs where we could most easily land with the
boat, and proffered us some of their food. What we
were able to learn of their life and customs while on
land, I will briefly relate to your majesty.</p>

<p>“They go nearly naked, wearing only about the
loins some skins of small animals similar to the
martens. A girdle of woven grass encircles the body,
to which they fasten the tails of animals, which hang
down as far as the knees. All the rest of the body is
nude, as is also the head. Some of them wear drapery
in like manner made of the feathers of birds. The color<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
of these people is black (<i>neri</i>), not very different from
that of the Ethiopians. Their hair is black and thick,
but not very long; it is worn tied back upon the head
in the form of a little tail.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> In person they are of good
proportion, of middle-stature, a little above our own,
broad across the breast, strong in the arms, and well-formed
in the legs and other parts of the body; the
only exception to their good looks is that they have
broad faces, but not all of them, for we saw many
who had sharp ones, with large black eyes and a
fixed expression. They are not very strong in body,
but acute in mind, active and swift of foot as far as
we could perceive by observation. They greatly resemble
in these two last particulars the people of
the East, especially those of the remote regions. We
were not able to learn much concerning their habits on
account of our short stay on land and the distance of
our ship from the shore.”</p>

<p>Verrazzano designated his first landing-place on
the coast of the New Land by calling it Diepa, the
Italian form of the French name Dieppe, that of the
port from which he had sailed to make discoveries in
the western hemisphere. Visconte de Maiollo, on his
map of the world made in 1527, places the name Diepa
on the coast of Francesca, a little north of Terra
Florida.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Describing his next place of anchorage, Verrazzano
says: “We found not far from this people another,
whose mode of life we judged to be similar to that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
the former. The whole shore is covered with fine sand
about fifteen feet deep, rising in the form of little hills
about fifty paces broad. Ascending farther, we found
several arms of the sea which, entering through inlets,
washed the shore on each side as the coast trends.
An extensive country appears, rising somewhat above
the level of the sandy beach in beautiful fields and
broad plains, covered with immense forests, more or
less dense, the foliage of the trees being of various
colors, too attractive and charming to be described. I
do not believe that these are like the Hercynian forest,
or the rough solitudes of Scythia, or the northern
regions full of vines and trees, but growing with palms,<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
laurels, cypresses, and other varieties of trees unknown
in Europe, which exhale a very sweet fragrance a
great distance. We could not examine them closely
for the reasons already mentioned, and not on account
of any difficulty in traversing the woods, which, on the
contrary, are easily penetrated.</p>

<p>“As the Orient stretches around to this country,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
I do not think that it is devoid of the same kind of
drugs and aromatic liquors, nor of other resources as
gold and the like, which the color of the earth indicated.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
The country abounds with many animals as
deer, stags, hares, and the like. It is plentifully supplied
with lakes and ponds of running water, and with
a great variety of birds, fit and useful for every kind of
pleasant and delightful sport. This land lies in 34°.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
The air is salubrious, pure, and of a temperature
neither hot nor cold. There are no impetuous winds
in these regions, the most prevalent being the northwest
and west.</p>

<p>“When we were there in summer-time the sky
was clear with little rain, and if fogs and mists were at
any time driven in by the south wind, they quickly
disappeared, and the sky became again serene and
bright. The sea is tranquil and not stormy. Although
the whole coast is low and without harbors, it is not
dangerous to navigate, being free from rocks and bold,
so that within four or five fathoms from the shore
there are twenty-four feet of water at all times of tide,
and this depth uniformly increases as you go farther
into the sea. The holding ground is so good that no
ship can part her cable, however strong the wind may
be, as we proved by experience, for while riding at
anchor on the coast we were overtaken by a gale in
the beginning of March, when the winds are high, as is
usual in all countries, and we found our anchor broken
before it started from its place or moved at all.”</p>

<p>“March being the season in our southern climate,
when vegetation of all kinds is putting forth,” says an
American writer, residing in South Carolina, “the
woods presented to the stranger a greater variety of
charms than he had ever beheld. The trees, green
and beautiful with the living verdure of our early
spring, were bending down with rich clusters of golden
jessamine, which spread their rich perfume over the
whole air, while the underbrush embraced a collection
of aromatic shrubs and wild flowers, which might easily
be mistaken for the rich spices of oriental production.”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>After inspecting the sandy, harborless shore of Onslow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
Bay, Verrazzano sailed eastwardly in order to
double Cape Lookout, in 34° 37´ north latitude. “We
set sail from this place,” he says, “continuing to coast
along the shore, which we found turned to the west,
[east in the direction in which he was sailing]. The
inhabitants were numerous, for we saw every-where
many fires.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> While at anchor on this coast, there being
no harbor to enter, we sent the boat to the shore with
twenty-five men to obtain water, but it was impossible
to land without endangering the boat, on account of
the very high surf thrown upon the shore by the sea,
as it was an open roadstead.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Many natives came to
the beach, and signified by various friendly signs that
we might trust ourselves on land. One of their noble
deeds of friendship deserves to be made known to your
majesty. A young sailor was attempting to swim
ashore through the surf to carry them some knick-knacks,
as little bells, looking-glasses, and similar
trifles, when after approaching near to three or four
natives and casting them the things and turning about
to get back to the boat, he was overturned by the
waves and so dashed by them upon the beach that he
lay there as if he were dead. When the people saw
him in this condition they ran and took him up by the
head, legs, and arms, and carried him some distance
from the surf. The young man, finding himself borne
off in this way, uttered very loud shrieks in fear and
dismay, while they answered as best they could in
their language, intimating that he had no cause for
fear. Afterward they laid him down at the foot of a
little hill, where they took off his shirt and trousers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
examined him, expressing the greatest astonishment
at the whiteness of his skin. Our sailors in the boat
seeing a great fire kindled and their companion placed
very near it, full of fear, as is usual in all cases of a
novel character, imagined that the natives were about
to roast him for food. But as soon as he had recovered
his strength, after a short stay with them, and had
shown by signs that he wished to return to the boat,
they affectionately hugged him and accompanied him
to the beach, where leaving him, they withdrew to a
little hill, that he might feel more free, and watched
him until he was safe in the boat. This young man
reported that these people were black as the others,
that they had shining skin, middle-stature, but sharper
faces and very delicate bodies and limbs, and that they
were inferior in strength but quicker in thought. This
is all he observed.”</p>

<p>After this adventure, which likely occurred somewhere
on the coast near the thirty-sixth parallel, perhaps
in the vicinity of Roanoke Island, North Carolina,
Verrazzano steered northwardly, and while sailing
at night passed by the entrance to Chesapeake Bay
and anchored off the coast of Virginia, some distance
north of Cape Charles, which is in 37° 3´.</p>

<p>“Departing from this place [the coast of North
Carolina], and always following the coast which trended
toward the north, we came,” says Verrazzano, “in the
space of fifty leagues to another land, which appeared
very beautiful and full of large forests. We approached
it and going ashore with twenty men, went back from
the coast about two leagues, and found that the people
had fled and hid themselves in the woods in fear. By
searching around we discovered in the grass a very
old woman with a young girl of about eighteen or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
twenty years of age, who had concealed themselves
for the same reason. The old woman carried two infants
on her shoulders, and behind her neck a little boy
about eight years old. When we came upon them
they began to shriek and make signs to the men who
had fled to the woods. We gave them a part of our
provisions, which they accepted with delight, but the
girl would not touch any, every thing we offered to
her being thrown down in great anger. We took the
little boy from the old woman to carry him with us to
France, and would have taken the girl also, who was
very beautiful and very tall, but it was impossible on
account of the piercing shrieks she uttered, when we
attempted to lead her away. Having to pass some
woods, and being far from the ship, we determined to
leave her and only take the boy. We found these
people fairer (<i>più bianchi</i>) than those we had passed.
From certain grasses hanging from the branches of
trees, they make their clothing; the grasses being
woven together with threads of wild hemp. Their
heads were uncovered and of the same shape as the
other natives we had seen. Their food is a kind of
pulse which abounds there, different in color and in
size from ours, and of a very pleasant taste. Besides
they use birds and fish for food, which they take with
snares, and bows made of hard wood. Their arrows
are reeds, in the ends of which they fasten the bones
of fish and of animals. The animals in these regions
are wilder than those in Europe by being more frequently
molested by those hunting them. We saw
many of their boats constructed of a single tree,
twenty feet long and four feet wide, fabricated without
the use of stone or iron or other metal. Along the
whole coast which we explored for the space of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
hundred leagues, we saw no stone of any sort. To
hollow out the log they burn as much of it as will form
the concave part of the boat, and also form the ends
which are to be the prow and stern, to make the boat
float well. The land in situation, fertility, and beauty
is like the other, covered with forests, filled with different
kinds of trees but not such fragrant ones, since
the region is farther north and colder.”</p>

<p>While exploring the peninsula of Virginia, the
warm-hearted and sympathetic Florentine was pleasingly
reminded of his own delightful country by seeing
many wild grape-vines festooning the tall forest trees.
He observed that the savages carefully removed the
shading shrubbery near the prolific vines, so that the
ripening rays of the sun could fall on the green fruit.</p>

<p>“We saw in this country,” he says, “many vines
growing naturally, entwining themselves about the
trees, climbing as they do in Cisalpine Gaul, which, if
they were dressed in the right way of cultivation by
husbandmen, they would produce without doubt the
best of wines, because often the fruit of that drinking
is agreeable and sweet, seeing it is not different from
our own, (<i>perche più volte il frutto di quello beendo, veggendo
suave e dolce non dal nostro differente</i>). The
vines are held in high estimation by the inhabitants,
for they take away all the surrounding concealing
shrubbery to enable the fruit to grow.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>“We also found,” Verrazzano further relates, “wild
roses, violets, lilies, and many kinds of plants and
fragrant flowers differing from our own. We cannot
describe the habitations of the people as the structures
were in the interior, but from various indications we
concluded they were formed of trees and shrubs.
There were also many signs which led us to suppose
that the inhabitants often sleep in the open air without
any covering but the sky. We are ignorant of their
other habits. We believe, however, that all the people
we were among live in the same way.”</p>

<p>When Verrazzano was on land with the twenty
men, he crossed the narrow peninsula of Virginia and
beheld the wide expanse of Chesapeake Bay.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This
great body of water, stretching toward the north and
south as far as he could see, and spreading westward to
an unknown distance, led the surprised explorer to
imagine that it was a part of the Indian Ocean, (<i>Mare
Indicum</i>), by which, if there were a navigable entrance
to it, he might sail to Cathay.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Ignorant of the fact that
he had already passed at night the channel leading to this
expanse of water, Verrazzano entertained the thought
that he might discover one along the coast farther
northward. Although he determined not to sail again
at night along the New Land, and resolved to inspect
its coast more closely thereafter, he failed to find a
passage to the assumed western sea, when he sailed
northward. After returning to France, he made a map<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
on which he represented this sea separated from the
Atlantic Ocean by a narrow neck of land, similar in outline
and situation to the northern part of the peninsula
of Virginia. This is corroborated by Hakluyt, the
English collector, who says: “Master John Verazanus,
which had been thrise on that coast, in an olde excellent
mappe which he gave to King Henrie the eight,
and is yet in the custodie of Master Locke, doth so lay
it out.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p class="caption">ON MERCATOR’S PROJECTION.</p>
</div>

<p>Verrazzano’s brother, Hieronymus, also made a map
of New France, on which he placed this explanatory
inscription respecting this part of the coast, which he
also delineates as a narrow tract of land: “From this
eastern sea [the Atlantic] one beholds the western sea;
there are six miles of land between them.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The Sea
of Verrazzano (<i>Mare de Verrazana</i>), represented on
the fan-shaped map made by Michael Locke, in 1582,
was, as Hakluyt affirms, “according to Verazanus
plat,” which “laieth out the sea makinge a little necke
of land in 40 degrees of latitude much like the streyte
necke or istmus of Dariena.”<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Sailing northwardly from the peninsula of Virginia,
Verrazzano proceeded leisurely along the coast
searching for an entrance to the so-called western
sea. Although he does not speak of entering Delaware
Bay, there is no testimony to contradict the assertion
that he explored it. Describing his voyage along
the coasts of the present states of Maryland, Delaware,
and New Jersey, Verrazzano writes: “After having
remained here three days, riding at anchor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
off the coast [of Virginia], for we could not find a
harbor, we determined to depart, sailing always
along the shore, which trended to the northeast, only
navigating in day-time and coming to anchor at night.”</p>

<p>About the last of April, 1524, the Dauphine arrived
off the low point of land, now called Sandy Hook,
designated on Maiollo’s map of 1527 as C. de S. Maria
(Cape of St. Mary).<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Seeing the convenient haven
north of it, Verrazzano changed the vessel’s course and
slowly sailed into the spacious roadstead. Having
found a suitable riding-place, the French barque cast
her anchor in the sight of a multitude of interested
natives, who from the neighboring hills witnessed the
first mooring of a European ship in the tranquil waters
of the large bay.</p>

<p>The ship’s boat being manned, Verrazzano began
to explore the mouth of the great river, as he designated
the channel now called the Narrows. Eager to know
the destination of the strange explorers, the curious
natives thronged the shores of Staten and Long islands
as Verrazzano and his men passed up the Narrows in
mid-stream toward the upper bay, which the enthusiastic
Italian denominated a very beautiful lake. Entering
the commodious bay, Verrazzano hastily surveyed its
islands and inlets, the mouth of the noble river flowing
into it, and the distant highlands dimly defined along
the northern horizon. Describing his short exploration
of the upper bay of New York, Verrazzano writes:</p>

<p>“At the end of one hundred leagues we discovered
a very delightful place among some small hills, eminences,
between which ran a very great river (<i>una grandissima
riviera</i>) to the ocean, which was deep within
to the mouth, and from the sea to the enlargement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
the bay the rise of the tide was eight feet, and through
it any heavy ship can pass.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>“As in good duty we did not wish to run the risk
of penetrating the coast without knowledge of the mouth
of the river, we took the boat and entered the river within
the country where we found it to be thickly inhabited
and the people resembling the others we had seen,
adorned with birds’ feathers of different colors, coming
toward us with evident delight, uttering very loud cries
of admiration, indicating, if we had to land with the
boat, where it was most safe. We entered the said
river within the country about half a league, where
we saw it formed a most beautiful lake (<i>un bellissimo
lago</i>), about three leagues in compass, upon which we
saw boats, thirty in number, moving from one part to
another with innumerable people, who passed from
shore to shore to see us.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Very suddenly, as is wont
to happen to those navigating, an impetuous contrary
wind blew in from the sea, compelling us to return to
the ship. We departed from this region with much
displeasure on account of its extent and attractiveness,
for we believed that it was not without some resources
of wealth as all the hills indicated the existence of
minerals in them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>As a geographical designation for the very great
river (<i>una grandissima riviera</i>), the name Grande
(Great) River was used by some of the most celebrated
map-makers of Europe, during the sixteenth century.
In the seventeenth century, when the Dutch took
possession of this part of New France, the Dutch synonym,
“Groote,” was substituted for the Italian designation.
The Spaniards, who explored the coast of
North America after Verrazzano had inspected it, gave
different names to the river.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson was induced to explore the Grande
River by Captain John Smith, who believed that the
English navigator could find a strait connecting it with
the western sea (Mare Indicum) delineated on Verrazzano’s
map. In the summer of 1609, when Hudson
attempted to sail to Asia by a passage north of Novaya
Zemlya, and was compelled to abandon the project
on account of the barrier of ice surrounding the island,
it is said he placed before the officers and crew of the
Half Moon (Halve Maen), the choice of one of two proposals.
Respecting the proposals of which they had the
consideration, the Dutch historian, Van Meteren, thus
speaks: “Master Hudson gave them their choice of
two things, the first was to go to the coast of America,
at the fortieth degree of latitude, mostly incited to this
by letters and maps which a certain Captain Smith had
sent him from Virginia, and on which he showed him
a sea by which he might circumnavigate their southern
colony [Virginia] from the north, and from there pass
into a western sea. The other proposal was to seek
the passage by Davis’s Strait.”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Hudson, besides knowing the situation of the noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
stream, was also informed that it was called the Great
(Grande) River. Robert Juet, the journalist of the
voyage of 1609, recording the incidents of the last
day’s exploration of the river, writes: “Within a
while after, we came out also of the great mouth of
<i>the great Riuer</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>De Laet, the Dutch historian, writing in 1625,
mentions the fact that the Dutch used the name
“Great” for the river in preference to all the other
appellations designating it: “The great north river
of New Netherland was called by some the Manhattes
river, from the people who dwell near its mouth; by
others, Rio de Montaignes (River of the Mountains),
but by our countrymen it was mostly called ‘<i>de groote
rieviere</i>’ (the Great river).”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> As early as the year
1624, the name “Hudson’s River” was inscribed on
maps to designate the stream discovered by Verrazzano.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Sailing from the mouth of the Grande River, between
the Cape of Saint Mary (C. de S. Maria) and
the point of land denominated Anguileme<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> on Maiollo’s
map of 1527, Verrazzano coasted along the south side
of Long Island for fifty leagues, at the end of which
he passed the eastern extremity of the island, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
called Montauk Point. While seeking, during a storm,
a port of refuge eastward of Long Island, Verrazzano
discovered the island now called Block Island, which
he describes as triangular in form, and in size about
equal to the island of Rhodes.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Block Island lies
southwest of Narragansett Bay, and is about eight
miles long and about five miles broad at its widest
part. Verrazzano called it Luisa, the name of the
mother of King Francis I., Louise, the daughter of
Philippe, duke of Savoy. The orthography of the
Italian name, as presented by Visconte de Maiollo
on his map of the world of 1527, was soon corrupted
by map-makers, and on a number of charts of the sixteenth
century it is inscribed “Brisa” and “Briso.”
The names “Claude” and “Claudia” appear on some
maps as designations for it, used most likely, in honor
of Claude, the wife of Francis I., the first being the
French orthography of the appellation, and the latter
the Italian.</p>

<p>The departure of the Dauphine from the mouth of
the Grande River, Verrazzano thus describes: “Weighing
anchor, we sailed fifty leagues toward the east, as
the coast trended in that direction, and always in sight
of it. At the end of the course we discovered an
island of a triangular form about ten leagues from the
main-land, in size about equal to the island of Rhodes,
having many hills covered with trees, and well peopled,
judging from the great number of fires we saw
all around it. We gave it the name of your majesty’s
illustrious mother. We did not land on it, as the
weather was unfavorable.”</p>

<p>Sailing northeasterly from Block Island, the Italian
explorer beheld the coast of the main-land, and anchored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
the Dauphine in Narragansett Bay, Rhode
Island. Speaking of the discovery of the commodious
bay, designated on Maiollo’s map by the Italian name,
“Refugio,” Verrazzano says:</p>

<p>“We proceeded to another place fifteen leagues
distant from the island, where we found a very excellent
harbor. Before entering it we saw about twenty
small boats filled with people, who came to the ship
with various cries and wonderment. But they would
not approach nearer than fifty paces. Stopping, they
looked at the structure of the ship, our persons, and
dress. Afterward they all cried out loudly together,
signifying that they were delighted. By imitating
their signs we inspired them with a measure of confidence,
so that they came near enough for us to toss
them some little bells and glasses and many toys,
which they took and looked at laughing, and then
came on board without fear. Among them were two
kings more attractive in form and stature than can be
described. One was about forty years old, the other
about twenty-four, and they were dressed in the following
fashion.</p>

<p>“The elder king had the skin of a deer wrapped
around his nude body, artificially made with various
embroideries to decorate it. His head was bare. His
hair was bound behind with various bands, and around
his neck he wore a large chain ornamented with many
stones of different colors. The younger king was like
him in appearance. This was the finest-looking people
and the handsomest in their costumes that we found
in our voyage. They exceed us in size, and are of a
very fair complexion (<i>sono di colore bianchissimo</i>);
some of them incline more to a white, and others to a
tawny color. Their faces are sharp; their hair is long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
and black, on the adornment of which they bestow
great care. Their eyes are black and keen; their
demeanor is gentle and attractive, very much like that
of the ancients. I say nothing to your majesty of the
other parts of the body that are all in good proportion
as belong to well-formed men.</p>

<p>“The women resemble them in size, and are very
graceful and handsome, and quite attractive in dress
and manners. They had no other clothing except a
deer-skin, ornamented as were the skins worn by the
men. Some had very rich lynx-skins upon their arms,
and wore various ornaments upon their heads, braided
in their hair, which hung down upon their breasts.
Others wore different ornaments, such as those of the
women of Egypt and Syria. The older and the married
people, both men and women, wore many ornaments
in their ears, hanging down in Oriental fashion.</p>

<p>“We saw on them pieces of wrought copper, which
is more esteemed by them than gold, the latter being
deemed the most ordinary of metals, yellow being a
color much disliked by them. Blue and red are the
colors which they value most highly. Of the things
which we gave them, they preferred the bells, azure
crystals, and other toys, which they hung in their ears
and about their necks. They do not value or desire to
have silk or gold-drapery, or other kinds of cloth, nor
implements of steel or iron. When we showed them
our weapons, they expressed no admiration, and only
asked how they were made. The same indifference
was manifested when they were given the looking-glasses,
which they with smiles returned to us as soon
as they had looked at them. They are very generous,
giving away whatever they have.</p>

<p>“We formed a great friendship with them, and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
day we entered into port with our ship, having before
rode at the distance of a league from the shore, as the
weather was unfavorable. They came to the ship with
a number of their little boats, with their faces painted
with different colors, manifesting real signs of joy,
bringing us of their provisions, and signifying to us
where we could best ride in safety with our ship,
and keeping with us until we had cast anchor.</p>

<p>“We remained among them fifteen days to provide
ourselves with many things of which we were in
want, during which time they came every day to see
our ship, bringing with them their wives, of whom they
were very careful, for, although they came on board
themselves, and remained a long while, they made
their wives stay in the boats, nor could we ever get
them on board by any solicitations or any presents we
could make them. One of the two kings, however,
often came with his queen and many attendants to see
us for his amusement. But he always stopped on land
at the distance of about two hundred paces from us,
and sent a boat to announce his intended visit, saying
they would come and see our ship. This was done
for safety, and as soon as they had received our answer,
they came and remained some time to look
around. On hearing the annoying cries of the sailors,
the king sent the queen, with her attendants, in a very
light boat to wait, near an island, a quarter of a league
distant, while he remained a long time on board, talking
with us by signs, and expressing his fanciful notions
about every thing in the ship, and asking the use
of all. After imitating our modes of salutation, and
tasting our food, he courteously took leave of us.
Once, when our men remained two or three days on
a small island near the ship for their various necessities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
as sailors are wont to do, he came with seven or
eight of his attendants to inquire about our movements,
often asking us if we intended to remain there long,
and offering us every thing at his command. Sometimes
he would shoot with his bow, and run up and
down with his people, making great sport for us. We
often went five or six leagues into the interior, and
found the country as pleasant as can be conceived,
adapted to cultivation of every kind, whether of corn,
wine, or oil. There are open plains twenty-five and
thirty leagues in length, entirely free from trees or
other obstructions, and so fertile that whatever is sown
there will yield an excellent crop. On entering the
woods, we observed that they might all be traversed
by any large army. The trees in them were oaks, cypresses,
and others unknown in Europe. We found,
also, apples, plums, filberts, and many other fruits, but
of a different kind from ours. The animals, which are
in great numbers, stags, deer, lynx, and many other
kinds, are taken with snares and by bows; the latter is
the principal weapon of the natives. Their arrows are
beautifully made. For points they use emery, jasper,
hard marble, and other sharp stones instead of iron.
They also use the same kind of sharp stones in cutting
down trees, and with them construct their boats of single
logs, hollowed out with admirable skill, and sufficiently
commodious to seat ten or twelve persons. Their
oars are short, with broad blades, and are rowed by
the force of the arms, with the greatest care and as
rapidly as they wish.</p>

<p>“We saw their dwellings, which are circular in form,
about ten or twelve paces in circumference, made of
logs split in half, without any regularity of architecture,
and covered with roofs of straw, nicely put on, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
protect them from wind and rain. There is no doubt
that they would build stately edifices if they had workmen
as skillful as ours, for the whole sea-coast abounds
with shining stones, crystals, and alabaster, and on this
account it has dens and retreats for animals. They
change their habitations from place to place, as circumstances
of situation and season may require. This is
easily done, for they have only to take with them their
mats, and they have other houses immediately prepared.</p>

<p>“The father and the whole family dwell together
in one house. In some of their houses we saw twenty-five
or thirty persons. Their food is pulse, as that of
the other people, which is here better than elsewhere,
and more carefully cultivated. In the time of sowing
they are governed by the moon, which they think effects
the sprouting of the grain. They have many
other ancient customs. They live by hunting and
fishing, and they are long lived. If they fall sick ...<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
they cure themselves without medicine, with
the heat of fire. Death comes to them at last from
extreme old age. We judged them to be very affectionate
and charitable toward their relatives, for they
make loud lamentations in their adversity, and in their
misery call to remembrance all their good deeds.
When they die their relations mutually join in weeping
mingled with singing for a long while. This is all
that we could learn of them.</p>

<p>“This region is situated on the parallel of Rome,
in 41⅔ degrees, as I shall narrate hereafter to your
serene majesty.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> At present I shall describe the situation
of this place. At its south end the channel is narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
and a half league wide. It extends, between east
[south?], and north, twelve leagues. Then it enlarges
and forms a very spacious bay twenty leagues in circuit,
in which are five small islands, very fertile and
attractive, and covered with high trees. The bay is so
spacious that between these islands any number of
vessels might ride at ease without fear of tempests and
other dangers. At the entrance of the bay, farther
south, there are very attractive hills on both sides of
the channel, and many streams of clear water flow
from the eminences into the sea. In the middle of the
mouth there is a rock of freestone (<i>uno scoglio di viva
pietra</i>), formed by nature and suitable for the construction
of any kind of machine or bulwark for the defence
of the haven.”</p>

<p>Verrazzano’s description of Narragansett Bay,
named Port du Refuge on Gastaldi’s map of 1553,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> is
so accurate that without any other information it would
be easy to determine the situation of the place where
for fifteen days, ending the sixth of May (<i>old style</i>), he
and his crew held familiar intercourse with the friendly
Indians inhabiting the islands and the main-land in the
vicinity of the anchorage of the Dauphine. The latitude
of the bay given by Verrazzano cannot be gainsaid.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>Departing, on the sixth of May, from Port du
Refuge, the Dauphine sailed on a southeasterly course to
pass the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
Having steered fifty leagues in this direction, Verrazzano
found the coast to trend toward the north, which
he followed until he again cast anchor off the coast of
Maine, a little north of the forty-third parallel.</p>

<p>The wary aborigines of this part of the New Land
would not venture near the Dauphine, nor could they be
induced to part with their commodities until they were
remunerated with such things as were most useful to
them. The landing of twenty-five men from the vessel
provoked an attack, and yet after this show of hostility
the Indians fled to the woods.</p>

<p>Speaking of his departure from Narragansett Bay,
Verrazzano writes: “Having supplied ourselves with
every thing necessary, on the sixth of May [<i>old style</i>],
we departed from the port, and sailed one hundred and
fifty leagues, keeping close enough to the coast not to
lose it from our sight. The character of the country
appeared much the same as before, but the mountains
were a little higher, and in all appearance rich in
minerals.</p>

<p>“We did not stop to land, as the weather was very
favorable for pursuing our voyage, and the country
presented no variety. The shore stretched to the east,
and fifty leagues beyond more to the north, where we
found a more elevated country, full of very dense woods
of pine, cypress, and the like, indicative of a cold
climate.</p>

<p>“The people were entirely different from the others
we had seen, whom we had found kind and gentle, but
these were so rude and barbarous that we were unable,
by any signs we could make, to hold any communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
with them. They clothe themselves with the skins
of bears, wolves, lynx, marine, and other animals. Their
food, which we inferred from several visits to their
dwellings, is obtained by hunting and fishing. They
have certain vegetables which are roots of spontaneous
growth. They have no pulse, and we saw no signs of
its cultivation. The land appears sterile and unfit for
the growth of fruits or grain of any kind. If we wished
at any time to traffic with them, they came to the sea-shore
and stood upon the rocks, from which they lowered
down by a cord to our boats beneath whatever
they had to barter, continually crying out to us not to
come nearer, and instantly demanding from us that
which was to be given in exchange. They took from
us only knives, fish-hooks, and sharpened steel. No
regard was paid to our courtesies. When we had
nothing left to exchange with them, the men at our
departure made the most brutal signs of disdain and
contempt possible. Against their will, we penetrated
two or three leagues into the interior with twenty-five
men. When we came to the shore, they shot at us
with their arrows, uttering the most horrible cries, and
afterward fleeing to the woods. In this region we
found nothing extraordinary except vast forests, and
some metalliferous hills as we inferred, for we saw that
many of the people wore copper ear-rings.”</p>

<p>Following the trend of the coast of Maine, Verrazzano
found along this part of his course for the space
of fifty leagues, numerous islands, thirty-two of which,
near the main-land, were high and attractive. Among
them he saw many excellent roadsteads and navigable
channels.</p>

<p>Describing his exploration along the coast of Maine,
Verrazzano remarks: “Departing from this place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
[perhaps in the vicinity of Cape Neddock], we kept
along the coast steering to the northeast, and found
the country more pleasant and open, free from woods,
and far in the interior we saw lofty mountains, but
none which extended to the shore.</p>

<p>“Within fifty leagues we discovered thirty-two
small and attractive islands, all near the main-land.
They were so high and so disposed as to afford as fine
harbors and channels as those that are in the Adriatic
Gulf, near Illyria and Dalmatia. We had no intercourse
with the people, but we judge that they were
similar in disposition and habits to those we were last
among.</p>

<p>“After sailing between east and north the distance
of one hundred and fifty more leagues, and finding our
provisions and naval stores nearly exhausted, we took
in wood and water, and determined to return to France,
having discovered five hundred and two, that is to say,
seven hundred leagues of new land (<i>avendo discoperto
leghe 502 cioe leghe 700 più di nuova terra</i>).”</p>

<p>The distance of seven hundred leagues Verrazzano
reckoned in the following way, as explained by him in
his geographical exposition of the voyage: “In addition
to the 92 degrees we ran toward the west from
our point of departure before we reached land on the
thirty-fourth parallel, we have to count 300 [French]
leagues, which we ran northeastwardly and 400 nearly
east along the coast before we reached the fiftieth parallel
of north latitude.” Measured directly north from
the thirty-fourth parallel to the fiftieth, the space includes
sixteen degrees, which multiplied by 31¼
French leagues, which at that time equaled a degree
of latitude, the product of 500 French leagues is
obtained.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Two leagues added to these, for the distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
sailed directly south of the thirty-fourth parallel,
make 502 French leagues, or about eleven hundred
and four land-miles, the geographical extent of the
coast explored by Verrazzano.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The New Land
(<i>Nuova Terra</i>), discovered by Verrazzano, was as early
as the year 1527 delineated on a map of the world
and denominated Francesca. This Italian name it bore
for a number of years until the French geographical
designation La Nouvelle France (New France) was
substituted for it.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Concluding his description of the new country, Verrazzano
remarks: “As to the religious faith of all these
tribes, not understanding their language, we could not
learn either by signs or gestures any thing certain. It
seemed to us that they had no religion or laws, nor any
knowledge of a First Cause or Mover,—that they worshipped
neither the heavens, stars, sun, moon, nor the
other planets. We could not learn if they were given
to any kind of idolatry, or offered any sacrifices or
supplications, or if they have temples or houses of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
prayer in their villages. Our conclusion was that they
had no religion, but lived without any. This seems to
be the result of ignorance, for they are very easily persuaded,
and imitated us with earnestness and fervor in
all that they saw us do as Christians in our acts of devotion.”</p>

<p>Verrazzano added to this general description of his
remarkable discoveries, an elaborate cosmographical
explanation of the situation of the New Land. His
geometrical elucidation of the distances sailed by the
Dauphine, shows how desirous he was to make plain
the geography of the vast continent, which he and
others had partly explored. He says:</p>

<p>“It remains for me to place before your serene
majesty a cosmographical description of the voyage.
As I have already said, we departed from the desert-rocks,
lying in the extreme part of the West known to
the ancients, and in the described meridian near the
Fortunate Islands, on the thirty-second parallel from
the equator of our hemisphere, and sailed from it westwardly
to where we found the first land, 1,200 leagues
or 4,800 miles, reckoning according to nautical custom
four miles to a [marine] league.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> ... During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
our voyage we had no lunar eclipses or similar celestial
phenomena. We therefore determined our progress
from the difference of longitude, which we ascertained
by various instruments, taking the sun’s altitude from
day to day, and by calculating geometrically the distance
run by the ship from one horizon to another.
All these observations, as also the ebb and flow of the
tide in all places, were noted down in a little book,
which may prove serviceable to navigators. They
are communicated to your majesty with the hope of
promoting science.</p>

<p>“My intention in this voyage was to reach Cathay,
on the extreme coast of Asia, expecting, however, to
find in the newly discovered land some obstacle as I
found, yet I did not doubt that I should sail by some
passage to the eastern ocean. It was the opinion of
the ancients that our eastern ocean of India was an expanse
of water without any intervening land. Aristotle
supports it by arguments founded on various probabilities,
but it is contrary to later belief and false by
observation. The discovered country, of which the
ancients knew nothing, is another world compared with
that which was before known, being evidently larger
than our Europe together with Africa, and, perhaps,
Asia, if one rightly estimate its extent, as shall now
be explained briefly to your majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> He then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
speaks of the Spaniards sailing as far south as the Strait
of Magellan and as far north as the twenty-first parallel
without finding a termination to the continent....</p>

<p>“But to return to ourselves:—in the voyage which
we have made by the order of your majesty, in addition
to the ninety-two degrees we ran toward the west
from the point of our departure before we reached land
on the thirty-fourth parallel, we have to count 300
leagues which we sailed northeastwardly, and 400
nearly east along the coast before we reached the
fiftieth parallel of north latitude, the point where we
turned our course from the shore toward home. Beyond
this point the Portuguese had sailed as far north
as the arctic circle without coming to the end of the
continent. Adding the degrees of south latitude explored,
which are fifty-four, to those of the north,
which are sixty-six, the sum is one hundred and twenty
degrees, and therefore more than are included in the
latitude of Africa and Europe, for the north point of
Norway, the extremity of Europe, is in 71° north
latitude, and the Cape of Good Hope, the southern
extremity of Africa, is in 35° south latitude, and their
sum is only one hundred and six degrees. If the
breadth of this newly discovered country correspond to
the extent of its sea-coast, it doubtless exceeds Asia in
size. In this way we find that the land forms a much
larger part of our globe than the ancients supposed,
who maintained, contrary to mathematical reasoning,
that it was less than the water, whereas actual experience
proves the reverse, so that judging in respect to
extent of surface, the land covers apparently as much
space as the water.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>“I hope to point out and explain more clearly and
satisfactorily the great extent of the New Land or New
World, of which I have been speaking. Asia and
Africa, we know, are joined together and are connected
with Norway and Russia with Europe, which disproves
the idea of the ancients that all this northern part had
been navigated from the promontory of Cimbri [Denmark]
eastward as far as the Caspian Sea. They also
maintained that the whole continent was surrounded
by two oceans, lying east and west of it, which seas in
fact do not surround either of the two continents, for as
we have already seen the land in the western hemisphere
at 54° south latitude extends eastwardly an unknown
distance, and that the land north of the equator,
beyond the sixty-sixth parallel, turns to the east and
does not terminate at the seventieth parallel.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>“In a short time, I hope we shall have more satisfactory
information concerning these things by the aid
of your serene majesty, whom I pray Almighty God to
prosper in lasting glory, that we may see the most
important results of this our geography in the fulfillment
of the holy words of the gospel.</p>

<p>The safe return of Verrazzano to France and his
remarkable discoveries along the new continent were
immediately heralded through Europe. The letter
which he wrote on his arrival at Dieppe was at once
eagerly copied and the transcripts widely circulated.
In less than a month’s time the news of the navigator’s
extensive explorations was spread over France, and
became a prominent topic of conversation. The commercial
advantages likely to accrue to France by the
important discovery of a country thickly populated and
rich in drugs, furs, and metals were everywhere discussed,
and Verrazzano’s presence at the chief centres
of trade was much desired that more information
might be obtained respecting the people and the productions
of the New Land.</p>

<p>A Florentine, named Fernando Carli, a person
well acquainted with Verrazzano’s former voyages, was
in Lyons at the time when the surprising intelligence
reached that city. He obtained a copy of Verrazzano’s
letter, and sent it to his father in Florence, inclosed
in the following communication:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“In the name of God.</p>

<p class="right">“August 4, 1524.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Honored Father:—</p>

<p>“Considering that when I was in the army in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
Barbary, at Gierbe, the news was sent you every day
by the illustrious gentleman, Don Hugo de Moncada,
captain-general of his Cesarean majesty in those barbarous
parts, what followed contending with the Moors
of that island, which seemed to have pleased our
patrons and friends; and also the congratulatory news
of the subsequent victory; [I now send you] the
news [which] has recently reached this place, of the
arrival of Captain Giovanni da Verrazzano, our Florentine,
at the port of Dieppe, in Normandy, with his
ship, the Dauphine, with which he sailed from the
Canary Islands, the last of January, to go in search of
new lands for this most serene crown of France, in
which enterprise he displayed very noble and great
courage in undertaking such an unknown voyage with
only one ship, a caravel of hardly tons burden,<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> with
only fifty men, with the intention, if possible, to
discover Cathay, steering a course through climates
other than those frequented by the Portuguese in going
to it by the way of Calicut, by keeping more to the
northwest and north, believing that, although Ptolemy,
Aristotle, and other cosmographers assert that no land
is to be found toward such climates, he would nevertheless
find land there, which God has permitted him,
as he distinctly describes in his letter to his serene
majesty, a copy of which is inclosed in this communication.
After spending many months in exploring, he
asserts that he was compelled to return for want of provisions
from that hemisphere into this one, having been
seven months on the voyage, showing a very great
and rapid passage, having accomplished a wonderful
and most extraordinary undertaking in the opinion of
those who understand the navigation of the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>“At the beginning of the voyage there was an unfavorable
opinion formed concerning it, many thinking
that there would be no more news respecting him and
his vessel, and that he would be lost on that side of
Norway, in consequence of the great ice which is in
the northern ocean.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> However, the great God, as the
Moor said, in order to give us every day proofs of his
infinite power, and to show how admirable is this
mundane sphere, has disclosed to him a breadth of
land, as you will perceive, of great extent, as shown
by good reasoning and by degrees of latitude and
longitude.</p>

<p>“He declares and shows it to be greater than
Europe, Africa, and a part of Asia; therefore a new
world (<i>ergo mundus novus</i>); and this exclusive of what
the Spaniards have discovered in several years in the
West; as it is hardly a year since Fernando Magellan
returned, who discovered a great country with one
ship out of the five sent on the discovery, from which
he brought spices much more excellent than the common
kind, and of his other ships no news has transpired
for five years. They are supposed to be lost.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>“What this our captain has brought he does not
state in his letter, except a very young boy taken from
those countries; but it is supposed he has brought a
sample of gold, which they do not value in those parts,
and of drugs and other aromatic liquors, in order to
confer here with several merchants after he shall have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
been in the presence of his most serene majesty.
And at this hour he should be with the king, and from
choice should come here soon, as he is much desired,
in order to be conversed with; moreover, here he will
find his majesty, the king, our sire, who is expected in
three or four days.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> And we hope that his serene
majesty will intrust him with a half dozen good vessels,
and that he will go on the voyage. If our Francisco
Carli be returned from Cairo, advise him to go at a
venture on this voyage with him, for I believe they
were acquainted at Cairo, where he [Verrazzano] was
for several years, and not only in Egypt and Syria,
but almost in all parts of the known world. On account
of his merits, he is regarded as another Amerigo
Vespucci, another Magellan, and even more than they.
We hope that, being provided with other good ships
and vessels, well-built and properly provisioned, he
will discover and develop a profitable traffic, and will,
our Lord God preserving his life, do honor to our
country in acquiring immortal fame and memory.
Alderotto Brunelleschi, who started with him, and by
chance turned back unwilling to accompany him
farther, will, when he hears this news, be discontented.</p>

<p>“Nothing else now occurs to me, as I have advised
you by others what is necessary. I commend
myself constantly to you, praying you to impart this
to our friends, not forgetting Pier Francisco Dagaghiano,
who, in consequence of being an experienced
person, will take much pleasure in it, and commend me
to him. Likewise to Rustichi, who will not be displeased,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>

</div>

<p>The notable success attending Verrazzano’s voyage
in 1524, it seems, induced the celebrated navigator to
undertake another in 1526. For the furtherance of
this project, he and five other persons entered into an
agreement in which it was stipulated that Philippe
Chabot, baron of Apremont, knight of the Order of
the King, governor and lieutenant-general of Burgundy,
admiral of France and of Brittany,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> was to furnish
him with two galleons then at Havre de Grace,
and a ship belonging to Jean Ango of Dieppe,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> of seventy
tons burden, and that the admiral was also to equip
and victual them for the voyage to the New Land.
The three vessels were to be ready to sail within two
months.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Before setting sail on this voyage, Verrazzano,
on Friday, the eleventh of May, 1526, gave to
his brother, Hieronymus, and Zanobus de Rousselay,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
a power of attorney by which they were empowered to
act for him in any matter pertaining to his interest;
and also, on the following day, a similar instrument to
Adam Godeffroy of Rouen, which authorized him to
transact certain business for the navigator.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> In each
of these legal instruments, Verrazzano is named “Jehan
de Varasenne, nobleman, captain of the ships equipped
to go on the voyage to the Indies.”</p>

<p>The French sea-captain, Jean Ribaut, in his report
to Admiral Gaspard de Coligni, of his first voyage to
Florida, in 1562, says that Verrazzano, after his return
to France, in 1524, “neuer ceassed to make suite vntil
he was sent thither againe, where at last he died.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>The voyage of 1526 was the third made by Verrazzano
to America: the first in 1508, with Thomas
Aubert; the second, in 1524, in the Dauphine. This
fact is corroborated by the well-informed English collector,
Hakluyt, who says that he “had been thrise on
that coast.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>Of Verrazzano’s death, Ramusio gives this account:
“In the last voyage which he made, having gone on
land with some of his men, he and they were all put
to death by the inhabitants, and in the presence of
those who were on board the ship were roasted and
devoured. Such was the terrible death of this valiant
gentleman, who, had not this misfortune happened
him, would, by the great knowledge and experience
which he had of maritime affairs and of navigation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
attended and favored by the large liberality of King
Francis, have discovered and made known to the
world, all that part of the earth up to the north pole,
and would not have been contented with only the exploration
of the coast, but would have attempted to
penetrate far inland, and as far as he could go.</p>

<p>“Many who had known and conversed with him,
have told me that he had declared that it was his
intention to persuade the most Christian king to send
from these parts a goodly number of people to settle
in some places of the new country which are of a temperate
climate and very fertile soil, with very beautiful
rivers and harbors capable of holding any fleet.</p>

<p>“Settlers in these places would be the means of
effecting many good results, and among others that of
bringing those barbarous and ignorant tribes to know
God and our most holy religion, showing them how to
cultivate the land, transporting some of the animals of
Europe to those vast plains; and finally, in time, discovering
the inland parts, and seeing whether or not
among the many islands in that part of the world any
passage to the South Sea exists, or that the West
Indies extend as far north as the pole.</p>

<p>“This and so much has been related respecting the
achievements and efforts of this brave gentleman, and
in order that his memory may not be buried and his
name pass into oblivion, we have desired to give to
the light the little information that has come into our
hands.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Hakluyt, speaking of the map which Verrazzano
had made and presented to King Henry VIII. of
England, which as late as the year 1584 was still preserved
by an English cartographer, says: “There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
mighty large olde mappe in parchemente, made as yt
shoulde seeme, by Verarsanus, traced all alonge the
coaste, from Florida to Cape Briton, with many Italian
names, which laieth oute the sea, makinge a little necke
of land in 40 degrees of latitude much like the streyte
necke or istmus of Dariena.” The English collector
also refers to a globe which he believed Verrazzano
made: “There is an old excellent globe in the Queens
privie gallery at Westminster, which also semeth to be
of Verarsanus makinge, having the coaste in Italian,
which laieth oute the very same straite necke of lande
in the latitude of 40 degrees, with the sea joyninge
harde on bothe sides, as it dothe on Panama and
Nombre di Dios; which were a matter of singular
importance, yf it shoulde be true, as it is not unlikely.”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Although the “mighty large olde mappe in parchemente”
of Verrazzano’s drafting is lost, there are several
maps extant which seemingly represent the territory
of North America as it was delineated by him.
The rarest and the most valuable of these is a vellum-map
of the world in the Ambrosian Library at Milan,
made in 1527. It is five feet seven inches long and
one foot eleven inches wide, and bears this inscription:
“<i>Vesconte de Maiollo conposuy hanc cartan. In Janua
anno dñy, 1527, die xx. decenbris.</i>” (Visconte de
Maiollo composed this chart, in Genoa, in the year
of the Lord, 1527, the twentieth day of December).
The narrow isthmus, near the fortieth parallel, and
the “number of Italian names” from “Tera Florida”
to “C. de Bertoni” on this map, fully agree with
Hakluyt’s description of Verrazzano’s chart.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Hieronymus, the brother of the navigator, it seems,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
also made a map of the New Land, which, it is conjectured,
he drafted in 1529.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The original is a planisphere
delineated on parchment, fifty-one by one hundred
and two inches. This map is in the Borgian
museum in Rome. The inscription: “<i>Hieronimus de
Verrazanus faciebat</i>” (Hieronimus de Verrazano made
it), permits the inference that the map was not the one
which Hakluyt described, for had Hieronymus da
Verrazzano’s name been inscribed on it, the English
collector, it seems, would have mentioned the fact.
The representation of the so-called Western Sea, or
“Mare Indicum” (the Chesapeake Bay), with the explanatory
inscription on Hieronymus da Verazzano’s
map, indicates that he had some knowledge of the
cartographic features of his brother’s chart, and of the
geographical <i>memoranda</i> recorded in the little book
which the latter speaks of in his letter to King Francis
I., and which he thought would be serviceable to other
navigators.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After the death of Verrazzano, the French, for a
time, made no attempt to search along the coast of the
new continent for a short and direct way to Cathay.
The losses sustained by the projectors of the expedition
of 1526, Ribaut says, gave “small courage to
sende thither agayne, and was the cause that this laudable
enterprise was left of, vntill the yeere 1534, at
which time his Maiestie [Francis I.] (desiring alwayes
to enlarge his kingdome, countreys, and dominions,
and the aduauncing the ease of his subiectes), sent
thither a Pilote of S. Mallowes, a Briton, named James
Cartier, well seene in the art and knowledge of Nauigation,
and especially of the North parts, commonly called
the new land, led by some hope to find passage that
waies to the south seas.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The two ships commanded by Cartier sailed from
the port of St. Malo, on the twentieth of April, 1534.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
Reaching Newfoundland on the tenth of May, Cartier
began to search for a navigable channel to India.
Three months were passed in exploring the coast of
Labrador and the Strait of Belle Isle and a part of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. On the fifteenth of August,
Cartier set sail for France, and arrived in the port of
St. Malo, on the fifth of September. In the following
year, Cartier sailed again to New France and explored
the St. Lawrence River to the island of Hochelaga, the
site of the city of Montreal. It is said that he was
told by the natives that from there it was only “a
month’s sailing to go to a land where cinnamon and
cloves are gathered.”<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Returning from this voyage,
Cartier reached St. Malo on the sixth of July, 1536.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>The first explorers of the new continent called its
inhabitants by different names. Columbus and his
Spanish companions, imagining the field of their discoveries
to be in Eastern Asia, named the aborigines
Indians (<i>Indios</i>), believing them to be natives of India.
Seven of the people of Canada, carried to France, in
1509, were described by a contemporaneous Latin writer
as wood or wild men (<i>homines sylvestres</i>).<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The French,
it appears, called the natives of New France <i>manants</i>
or <i>manans</i>, and <i>paysans</i>, peasants, the former name
being used in the middle ages as a designation for unintelligent
people or those of low condition. The
name <i>manants</i> was likewise a designation for persons
of this class living in villages and on farms. <i>Manants</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
properly speaking were the natives of a place, and the
<i>habitans</i> were those who came to it to reside.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The
French appellation <i>manants</i> or <i>manans</i> not only fitly
expressed the low condition of the natives of New
France, but it also gave prominence to the fact that
they dwelt in villages and were indigenous people.
The French, as late as the year 1677, called the old
Indians, or rather the descendants of the Senecas,
<i>paisans</i>, peasants.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The Italians also called the natives
of North America peasants, <i>paesani</i>.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The Manants living on the island on which the city
of New York is built, were very friendly to the French
who came to the Grande River, in the sixteenth
century, to traffic for furs. The Hollanders, however,
found them to be quite hostile in the following century.
De Laet, the Dutch historian, describing the natives of
the Groote River in 1625, remarks: “On the east side,
upon the main-land, dwell the Manhattans, a bad race
of savages, who have always been very obstinate and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
unfriendly toward our countrymen.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> He also says
that Hudson, in 1609, called the Great River “Manhattes
from the name of the people who dwelt at its
mouth.”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The wrong spelling of the French term <i>manant</i>
began with a misconception of its proper pronunciation.
The Dutch thinking that the <i>t</i> was sounded,
pronounced the name <i>man-ant</i>, whence “<i>man-hat</i>,”
“<i>man-ath</i>,” “<i>man-ad</i>,” and other strange forms of the
name. Wassenaer, the Dutch historian, in 1624,

Manatthans, Manatthanes, and Manhattans.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>

French, spells the appellation Menates and Minates.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
In the deposition of Catelyn Trico, a French woman,
who emigrated from Holland, in 1624, to New Netherland,
the term is written Mannantans.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Besides these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
peculiar changes the name has many other anomalous
forms.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>When the first French explorers sailed along that
massive bulwark of trap-rock, now called The Palisades,
rising on the west side of the Grande River to
varying altitudes from two to five hundred feet above
the level of the stream, and ranging northward and
southward a distance of more than ten miles, they were
peculiarly impressed with its grandeur, and figuratively
called it L’Anormée Berge, (The Grand Scarp.)</p>

<p>The adjective <i>anormée</i> and the noun <i>berge</i> definitely
describe the steep and extensive wall of stone which
borders the noble river, now bearing the name of a
later explorer. <i>Anormé</i>, an obsolete form of the adjective
<i>énorme</i>, signifies that which is grand, vast,
majestic.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The noun <i>berge</i>, besides meaning an
elevated border of a river, a scarp of a fortification, a
steep side of a moat or of a road, is a designation for
certain rocks elevated perpendicularly above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
water.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> In an old French lexicon it is said: “They
likewise call in marine phraseology <i>bèrges</i> or <i>barges</i>
those great rocks, rugged and perpendicularly elevated,
that is to say, uprightly and plumb, as the <i>bèrges</i> or
<i>barges</i> of Olone: such rocks as are Scylla and Charybdis,
toward Messina.”<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>A more appropriate name could not have been selected
to designate geographically this part of New
France than that of The Land of the Grand Scarp (<i>La
Terre d’Anormée Berge</i>), or, in more familiar phraseology,
The Land of the Palisades. The words, scarp
and palisade, are terms of fortification. The first designates
the steep slope below the parapet of a fortification,
next to the ditch; the second an upright row of
strong stakes set firmly in the ground in front of the
counter-scarp, on the opposite side of the moat from
the scarp.</p>

<p>The mispronunciation of the peculiar geographical
name was evidently the cause of its orthography being
obscured so soon after it was used as the designation
for the elevated border of the Grande River. The more
frequent use thereafter of <i>énorme</i> for <i>anormé</i> made the
term more unfamiliar. It would seem also that when
the name should have been written <i>La Terre d’Énorme
Berge</i>, that it was inscribed, <i>La Terre de Normeberge</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
The change of the qualifying term to a word of two
syllables, as <i>norom</i>, <i>norum</i>, <i>nurum</i>, and <i>norim</i>, rendered
the name more ambiguous. In like manner the
noun <i>berge</i> was corrupted, being spelled <i>bergue</i>, <i>bega</i>,
<i>berg</i>, and <i>bagra</i>. In this way the territorial designation
became <i>La Terre de Norumbega</i>, <i>La Terre de Norembegue</i>,
<i>La Terre de Noromberge</i>, and <i>La Terre de Norembergue</i>,
and its meaning and derivation incomprehensible
to the descendants of its originators.</p>

<p>Gerard Mercator, on a terrestrial globe, (<i>globus
terrae</i>), made in 1541, represents the Grande River as if
its channel were filled with <i>anormée bèrges</i>, which he
designates with the misspelled name “Anorumbega.”<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
On a map of the world, made about the year 1548, for
King Henry II. of France, the appellation “Anorobagra”
designates the river of the Grand Scarp.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>In the sixteenth century proper names less peculiar
in construction than the appellation L’Anormée Berge,
were written very irregularly. It is said by Disraeli
that Leicester subscribed his name eight different
ways, and that Villers is spelled fourteen times differently
in the deeds of the family. Lower mentions
that the name of Mainwaring, has the remarkable number
of one hundred and thirty-one variations in different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
documents. Even in this age of dictionaries the
spelling of uncommon geographical names does not
always conform to their orthography. A record has
been kept for a number of years of the different ways
in which the name of the city of Cohoes, in the state
of New York, has been spelled on letters addressed to
that post-office, and the extraordinary number of one
hundred and ninety-seven changes in the form of the
appellation has been registered.</p>

<p>There seems to be but a single statement that might
be used to support an assertion that the natives of the
country of New France originated the name “Norumbega.”
It is in Ramusio’s Italian translation of the
French sea-captain’s description of Francesca, in which
it is said: “This region is called by the peasants Norumbega.”
René Goulaine de Laudonnière, a well-informed
French naval officer, who had command of a
French fort in Florida, in 1564, contradicts the assertion
that the name was transferred from an early map
of the eastern coast of Asia, saying: “It is called by the
moderns Terre de Norumberge.” André Thevet, the
French geographer, who sailed along its coast in 1556,
declares that his countrymen called the Grande River
“Norombègue,” and the Indians, “Aggoncy.”</p>

<p>One of the earliest accounts of the Land of the
Grand Scarp extant is in the discourse of the unnamed
sea-captain of Dieppe, written in 1539. Describing
the country of Francesca, he says: “Beyond Cape
Breton there is a region contiguous to this cape, the
coast of which extends west and a quarter southwest
as far as the region of Florida, and it stretches full
five hundred leagues, which coast was discovered
fifteen years ago, by Monsieur Giovanni da Verrazzano,
in the name of King Francis and of Madame, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
regent, and this region is called by many the land of
the French (<i>la Francese</i>), and likewise by the Portuguese,
and its termination toward Florida is in 78° west
longitude and 30° north latitude.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>“The inhabitants of this domain are a tractable
people, amiable and agreeable. The country abounds
with all kinds of fruit. Oranges and almonds grow in
wild forests, with many different varieties of odoriferous
trees. This region is called by the peasants (<i>paesani</i>)
Norumbega, and between it and Brazil there is a large
gulf, extending west as far as the ninety-second meridian.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>In 1540 Jacques Cartier again sailed to New
France and ascended the St. Lawrence River. Jean
François de la Roque, Sieur de Roberval, was placed
in command of this expedition, and, by letters-patent,
dated January 15, 1540, was commissioned viceroy
and lieutenant-general of the new lands belonging to
France in the western hemisphere. Jean Alphonse,
an experienced navigator, a native of Saintonge, near
the town of Cognac, France, accompanied Sieur de
Roberval as chief pilot.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>In the manuscript of the cosmography of Raulin
Secalart, written about the year 1545, preserved in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
National library, in Paris, is a short description of the
coast and people of La Terre d’Anormée Berge.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
The writer, evidently Jean Alphonse, very faithfully
describes Long Island Sound, the eastern entrance to
the Grande River, when he says: “This river is wider
than forty leagues of latitude at its mouth, and within,
the width is as much as thirty or forty leagues, and it
is full of islands, which extend ten or twelve leagues in
the sea, and it is very dangerous on account of rocks
and swashings.” These observations are remarkably
consonant with those of a later writer: “Long Island
Sound, a Mediterranean Sea, separating the island
from the main-land of Connecticut, is connected with
the ocean at each end of the island and affords a sheltered
line of navigation of about one hundred and
twenty miles in extent.... Opposite Harlem
River is the noted pass or strait called Hell-Gate,
which is crooked, and from the numerous rocks, islands,
eddies, and currents, is somewhat difficult and dangerous.”<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>The identity of the river called by the French
writer “Norombègue,” now the Hudson, is satisfactorily
established by the statement that the water of the
river is salty to the height of forty leagues or eighty-eight
miles. This fact is incontrovertible. The
Hudson is salty or brackish beyond the city of Poughkeepsie,
which is about ninety-three miles north of
Sand Hook.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The assertion could not be verified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
were it assumed that the description applies to the
Penobscot, or the Kennebec, or the Merrimack, or the
Connecticut River. It would seem that the writer
speaks of the Palisades bordering the west side of the
river, opposite the Indian village of “Norombègue,”
when he says: “On the side toward the west of the
said town there are many rocks which extend to the
sea, about fifteen miles.”</p>

<p>“I say that the Cape of St. John, called Cape Breton,
and the Cape of the Franciscan, are northeast and
southwest, and range a point from an east and west
course, and there are one hundred and forty leagues
on the course, and which makes one cape, called the
Cape of Norombègue. The said cape is in forty-one
degrees of the height of the arctic pole. The said
coast [<i>i. e.</i> of Connecticut] is all sandy, ...<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> flat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
without any mountain. And along this coast there are
many isles of sand and the coast very dangerous on
account of banks and rocks.</p>

<p>“The people of this coast and of Cape Breton are
an ill-disposed race, powerful, great arrow-makers, and
live on fish and on flesh, and are not talkative, and
speak almost the same language as those of Canada,
and are a great people. And those of Cape Breton go
to make war upon those of the New Land when they
are fishing, and not for any thing do they spare the life
of any one when they take him, unless it is a young
boy or a young girl; and they are so cruel that if they
take a man having a beard, they cut off his legs and
arms and carry them to their wives and children, in
order to be avenged in that way. And there are among
them many peltries of all animals.</p>

<p>“Beyond the Cape of Norombègue, the river of the
said Norombègue descends about twenty-five leagues
from the cape. The said river is wider than forty
leagues of latitude at its mouth [entrance of Long
Island Sound], and within, this width is as much as
thirty or forty leagues, and it is full of isles which
stretch out ten or twelve leagues in the sea [or Sound],
and it is very dangerous on account of rocks and
swashings. The said river is in forty-two degrees of
the height of the arctic pole.</p>

<p>“Up the said river, fifteen leagues, there is a town
which is called Norombègue, and there is in it a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
people, and they have many peltries of all kinds of
animals. The inhabitants of the town are dressed in
skins, wearing mantles of martens. I think that the
said river runs into the river Hochelaga [the St. Lawrence],
for it is salt for more than forty leagues up,
according to the statement of the people of the town.
The people use many words which resemble the Latin,
and they worship the sun, and are a handsome people,
and large framed. The land of Norombègue is high
and good.</p>

<p>“Before and on this side of the said river, one
hundred and fifty leagues, there is an island called
Vermonde [Bermuda?] which is in about thirty-three
degrees of the height of the arctic pole.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> And on the
west side of the said town there are many rocks which
extend to the sea, about fifteen leagues, and north of
it there is a bay, in which there is a small island, which
is often subject to tempests and cannot be inhabited.”</p>

<p>While Jean Alphonse was exploring the coast of
La Terre d’Anormée Berge (which at this time geographically
included all the country between the Grande
River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence), he ascended the
Grande River to the height of its navigation, from
which point he inferred that the stream extended to
the St. Lawrence, as it is represented on the map
made by Giacomo de Gastaldi, a Piedmontese cartographer,
about the year 1553.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> “I have been at a
bay as far as forty-two degrees, between Norumbega<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
and Florida, and I have not searched the end thereof,
and I know not whether it [the river] pass through....
I doubt not but [the river] Norumbega entereth
into the river of Canada, and unto the sea of
Saguenay.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>This opinion, that the Hudson was an outlet of the
St. Lawrence, was held by the Dutch as late as the
year 1625, for De Laet observes: “Judging from appearances
this river extends to the great river of St.
Lawrence, or Canada, since our skippers assure us
that the natives come to the fort [on the site of Albany]
from that river.”<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>René Goulaine de Laudonnière, a French officer,
commanding Fort Caroline, on the river May, in 1564,
gives, in his notable history of Florida, a short account
of Verrazanno’s discoveries in 1524.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> He says that
the French planted in the New Land “the ensigns and
arms of the king of France, so that the Spaniards
themselves, who were there afterward, have called this
country French land (<i>nõmé ce païs terre Francesque</i>)....
The east part of it is named by the moderns
Terre de Norumberge, which ends at the Gulf of Gamas,
which separates it from the island of Canada.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Not long after the discovery of Francesca by Verrazzano,
French barques were making voyages to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
coast, some to obtain cod-fish and others furs. As related
by Jean Alphonse, the people of the village of
L’Anormée Berge had “many peltries of all kinds of
animals.” The large quantities of beaver, otter, and
other skins obtained from the Manants, dwelling at the
mouth of the Grande River, induced the speculative
Frenchmen engaged in the traffic to erect at this
point a small fort, where their factors might reside and
more advantageously enlarge their purchases of furs.
The Indian village, on the island on which the city of
New York is built, was picturesquely situated on the
border of the deep, limpid lake, then covering the sites
of the plots of ground included between the lines of
Elm, Baxter, Worth, and Franklin streets. Near the
south end of the lake (which extended as far as the intersection
of Centre and Duane streets and emptied
into the Hudson at Canal Street) was a small island.
Eligible, and opposite the tongue of land on which the
Manants dwelt, the French fur factors selected it as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
site of the fortified trading house which they erected
and called Le Fort d’Anormée Berge (The Fort of the
Grand Scarp).<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>The French geographer, André Thevet, who sailed
along the coast of La Terre d’Anormée Berge, in
1556, besides corroborating some of the preceding
statements respecting the discovery of New France,
and mentioning the fact that the Grande River was
called by his countrymen the river of “Norombègue,”
and by the Indians “Aggoncy,” says<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>: “Having left
Florida on the left hand with a great number of
islands, islets, gulfs, and capes, a river presents itself,
one of the beautiful rivers that are in the world,
which we named Norombègue, and the Indians Aggoncy,
and which is marked on some marine charts
Grande river.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Several other beautiful rivers enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
this one, on which formerly the French had built a
small fort about ten or twelve leagues up it, which fort
was surrounded by fresh water that empties into the
river, and this place was called the fort of Norombègue.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>The site of the fort of L’Anormée Berge is indicated
by Gerard Mercator on his celebrated map of the
world, made at Duisburg, Germany, in 1569. The
famous cartographer not only designates the situation
of the French fort on the east side of the Grande River
with a conventional sign used by map-makers, but
also inscribes the name “Norombega” immediately
over it. As is seen, he outlines the Grande River to
the height of its navigation, at the confluence of the
Mohawk, as far as the French had explored it.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It seems that the French fur merchants undertook to
build, about the year 1540, a <i>château</i> or castle, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
height of the navigation of the Grande River. As it
appears, they selected a site for the building on the
long, low island lying in the bay, on the west side of
the river, near the present southern limits of the city
of Albany. The walls of the castle and its protecting
earthworks were almost completed when a great
freshet inundated the island and damaged the structure
so much that the French abandoned the occupation of
the island. Jean Alphonse evidently refers to the
abortive undertaking, when describing the situation of
the Indian village at the mouth of the Grande River, he
says: “North of it there is a bay, in which is a small
island that is often subject to storms, [those causing
freshets,] and cannot be inhabited.” The island bore
the name of Castle Island for more than a century thereafter,
but it is now known as Van Rensselaer’s Island.</p>

<p>The fact that the French had ascended the Grande
River to the height of its navigation to trade with the
Indians long before Henry Hudson explored it, is corroborated
by still stronger testimony than that already
presented. One of the earliest maps representing the
territory of Nieu Nederlandt (New Netherland), or
that part of New France which the French had called
La Terre d’Anormée Berge, is the figurative chart
presented to their high mightinesses, the Lords States
General of the United Netherlands, on the eleventh of
October, 1614, by a number of Dutch merchants,
praying for a special license to navigate and traffic
within the limits of this part of North America.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Upon
this map, made in 1614, are inscribed “curious notes
and <i>memoranda</i> concerning the natives of the country,”
which the well-informed discoverer of the chart intimates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
were written by one of the Dutch companions
of Henry Hudson, who accompanied the English
navigator, on the voyage of 1609.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> One of these explanatory
notes contains the undeniable testimony that
the French were the discoverers of the Grande River,
and that they had been trading with the Mohawks
long before the Half Moon sailed up the river. The
plain language of the inscription makes all explanation
of its meaning unnecessary: “But as far as one can
understand by what the Maquaas [Mohawks] <i>say and
show</i>, the French come with sloops as high up as their
country to trade with them.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Among the things which were shown to the Dutch
explorers by the friendly Mohawks to confirm what
they had said concerning the French, were the conspicuous
ruins of the unfinished castle. The sagacious
Hollanders, not unlikely thinking that the dilapidated
building might be repaired with little expense, and
made useful to them as a trading house, should they
be licensed by the government of the Netherlands to
return there to trade for furs with the Indians, took
measurements of its walls and outworks. These <i>memoranda</i>
they also inscribed on the map of New Netherland.
The castle, as described on the chart, was fifty-eight
feet wide between the walls, and built in the form
of a square, surrounded by a moat eighteen feet wide.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
The interior building was thirty-six feet long and
twenty-six wide.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Although the Dutch explorers never left any definite
information that they were personally the builders
of the fortification on Castle Island, yet by naming
it Fort Nassau, in honor of the stadtholder, Maurice,
prince of Orange and of Nassau, they permitted historians
to infer that they had constructed it, even before
they had been privileged by the government of
the Netherlands to occupy the country.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1680, the Dutch residents of
Albany were unenlightened respecting the nationality
of the builders of the fort, some supposing that the
Spaniards had erected it. This assumption was not
generally credited, as there were no facts known that
would verify the presence of the Spaniards in this
part of the country. The two Labadist missionaries,
Jasper Dankers and Peter Sluyter, who visited Albany
in 1680, thus speak of the fort on Castle Island, and of
the conjecture concerning the people who had built it:
“In the afternoon [Sunday, April 28th] we took a
walk to an island upon the end of which there is a fort
built, they say, by the Spaniards. That a fort had been
there is evident enough from the earth thrown up, but
it is not to be supposed that the Spaniards came so far inland
to build forts when there are no monuments of them
to be seen on the sea-coasts, where, however, they
have been according to the tradition of the Indians.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

Solon, an Athenian, who, having made a code of laws for the Athenians at

of seeing the world, that he might not be compelled to abrogate any of the laws

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The ships of the ancients, in the time of Herodotus, were vessels propelled
by oars and sails. Describing those used by the Egyptians on the Nile, he
says: “Their ships in which they convey merchandise are made of the
acacia, which in shape is similar to the Cyrenæan lotus, and its exudation is
gum. From this acacia they cut planks about two cubits in length, and join
them together as they do bricks, building their ships in the following manner:
They fasten the planks of two cubits length to stout and long ties; when
they have thus built the hulls, they lay rowing benches across them. They make
no use of ribs, but caulk the seams inside with byblus. They make only one
rudder, and that is driven through the keel. They use a mast of acacia, and
sails of byblus. These vessels cannot sail against the current of the stream
unless a fair wind prevails, but are towed from the shore. They are thus carried
down the stream: There is a hurdle made of tamarisk, wattled with a band of
reeds, and a stone bored through the middle, of about two talents in weight;
of these two, the hurdle is fastened to a cable, and let down at the prow of the
vessel to be carried on by the stream; and the stone by another cable at the
stern; and by this means the hurdle, by the stream bearing hard upon it, moves
quickly and draws along the ‘baris’, (for this is the name given to these vessels,)
but the stone, being dragged at the stern, and sunk to the bottom, keeps the
vessel in its course. They have a great number of these vessels, and some of
them carry many thousand talents.”—Euterpe xcvi.</p>

<p>The vessels of the Phœnicians were of a better build, but they also were
fitted out with oars and sails.—Ezekiel xxvii. 3-9.</p>

the seventeenth century, in a monastery on the island called Flatö, north of
Breidafjörd, in Iceland. This book of Flatö was purchased, about the year
1660, by Bishop Brynjulf Sveinson of Skalholt, in Iceland, and was sent by him
as a gift to King Frederic III. of Denmark, and is now in the Royal Library
of Copenhagen. A part of the inscription on the first page of the volume
bears this translation: “This book, Jónn, the son of Hakon, owns....
The priest, Jónn, the son of Thord, wrote out the narrative concerning Eric,
the traveller, and the histories of each of the Olafs; and the priest, Magnus,
the son of Thorhall, wrote out that which follows, also that which precedes,
and illuminated the whole. God Almighty and the Holy Virgin Mary bless
those who wrote and him who dictated.”</p>

<p>“Dag-mál, n. (<i>vide</i> dagr), prop. ‘<i>day-meal</i>,’ one of the divisions of the day,
usually about eight or nine o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; the Latin <i>hora tertia</i> is rendered by
‘er vér köllum dagmál,’ <i>which we call d.</i>, Hom. [Homiliu-bók], 142; enn er
ekki lidit af dagmálum, Hom. (St.) 10. Acts 11, 15; in Glúm. [Viga-Glúms
Saga], 342, we are told that the young Glúm was very lazy, and lay in bed till
day-meal every morning, cp. also 343; Hrafn. [Hrafnkéls Saga] 28 and O. H.
L. [Olafs Saga Helga Legendaria] 18—áeinum morni milli rismála ok dagmála—where
distinction is made between rismal (<i>rising time</i>) and dagmál, so
as to make a separate dagsmark (q. v.) of each of them; and again, a distinction
is made between ‘midday’ and dagmal, Ísl. [Islenzkar], 11, 334. The dagmal
is thus midway between ‘rising’ and ‘midday,’ which accords well with the
present use. The word is synonymous with dagver darmál, <i>breakfast-time</i>, and
denotes the hour when the ancient Icelanders used to take their chief meal,
opposed to náttmál, <i>night-meal</i> or <i>supper-time</i>, Fms. [Fornmanna Sögur], viii,
330; even the MSS. use dagmál and dagverdarmál indiscriminately; cp. also
Sturl. [Sturlunga Saga] 111, 4 C; Rb. [Rimbegla], 452 says that at full moon
the ebb takes place ‘at dagmá-lum.’ To put the dagmál at 7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, as Pál
Vidalin does, seems neither to accord with the present use nor the passage in
Glúm or the eccl. <i>hora tertia</i>, which was the nearest hour answering to the Icel.
calculation of the day. In Fb. [Flateyjar bók] 1,539, it is said that the sun set
at ‘eykd’ (<i>i. e.</i> half-past three o’clock), but rose at ‘dagmál,’ which puts the
dagmal at 8:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Compds. dagmála-stadr, m. <i>the place of d. in the horizon</i>,
Fb. [Flateyjar bók].”</p>

<p>“Eykt, eykd, f. <i>three or half-past three o’clock</i>, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; many commentaries
have been written upon this word, as by Pál Vidalin Skyr, Finn Johnson in H.
E. [Historia Ecclesiastica Islandiæ] 1. 153 sqq. note 6, and in Horologium,
etc. The time of eykd is clearly defined in K. Th. K. [Kristinnrettr Thorláks
ok Ketils], 92 as the time <i>when the sun has past two parts of the</i> ‘utsudr’ (q. v.)
<i>and has one part left</i>, that is to say, <i>half-past three o’clock</i>, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: it thus nearly
coincides with the eccl. Lat. <i>nona</i> (three o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>); and both eykt and nona
are therefore used indiscriminately in some passages. Sunset at the time of
‘eykd’ is opposed to sunrise at the time of ‘dagmal,’ q. v. In Norway ‘ykt’
means a luncheon taken about half-past three o’clock. But the passage in
Edda—that autumn ends and winter begins at sunset at the time of eykt—confounded
the commentators who believed it to refer to the conventional Icel.
winter, which (in the old style) begins with the middle of October, and lasts six
months. In the latitude of Reykholt—the residence of Snorri—the sun at this
time sets about half-past four. Upon this statement the commentators have
based their reasoning both in regard to dagmál and eykt, placing the eykt at
half-past four, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and dagmal at half-past seven, <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, although this contradicts
the definition of these terms in the law. The passage in Edda probably
came from a foreign source, and refers not to the Icel. winter but to the astronomical
winter, viz., the winter solstice or the shortest day; for sunset at
half-past three is suited not to Icel., but to the latitude of Scotland and the
southern parts of Scandinavia. The word is also curious from its bearing
upon the discovery of America by the ancients, <i>vide</i> Fb. [Flateyjar-bók] l. c.
This sense (<i>half-past three</i>) is now obsolete in Icel., but eykt is in freq. use in
the sense of <i>trihorium</i>, <i>a time of three hours</i>; whereas in the oldest sagas no
passage has been found bearing this sense,—the Bs. [Biskupa Sögur] 1, 385,
446, and Hem. [Hemings-thattr] l. c., are of the 13th and 14th centuries. In
Norway ykt is freq. used metaph. of all the four meal times in the day, morning-ykt,
midday-ykt, afternoon-ykt (or ykt proper), and even-ykt. In old MSS.,
Grág., K. Th. K. Hem. Heid. S. [Grágás, Kristinnrettr, Thorláks ok Ketils,
Hemings-thattr, Heidarviga Saga], this word is always spelt eykd or eykth,
shewing the root to be ‘auk’ with the fem. inflex. added; it probably first
meant the <i>eke</i>-meal, answering to Engl. <i>lunch</i>, and thence came to mean the
time of day at which this meal was taken. The eccl. law dilates upon the word,
as the Sabbath was to begin at ‘<i>hora nona</i>’; hence the phrase, eykt helgr dagr....</p>

<p>“Eyktar-stadr. m. <i>the place of the sun at half-past three</i>, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; meira var,
thar jafndaegri enn á Graenlandi edr Íslandi, sól hafdi thar eyktar-stad ok dagmála-stad
um skamdegi, Fb. [Flateyjar bók] 1, 539,—this passage refers to the
discovery of America; but in A. A. [Antiquitates Americanæ], l. c., it is
wrongly explained as denoting the shortest day nine hours long, instead of
seven; it follows that the latitude fixed by the editors of A. A. [Antiquitates
Americanæ] is too far to the south.”</p>

<p>“Dagr, m. ... a day, ... 5. the day is in Icel. divided according
to the position of the sun above the horizon; these fixed traditional
marks are called dags-mörk, <i>day-marks</i>, and are substitutes for the hours of
modern times, viz. ris-mál or midr-morgun, dag-mál, há-degi, mid-degi or mid-mundi,
nón, midr-aptan, nátt-mál.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> Thormod Torfason, or Torfæus, as his name is Latinized, in the addenda
of his History of Ancient Vinland (Historia Vinlandiæ Antiquæ), printed at
Copenhagen, in 1705, explains the meaning of the words, saying that the sun in
Vinland, on the shortest day, was six hours above the horizon, which would imply
that this land lay between the fifty-eighth and sixty-first parallels of north
latitude. “Torfæus confirms his interpretation by the authority of Arngrim
Jonas, a learned Icelander who flourished at the end of the sixteenth and beginning
of the seventeenth century, and who was deemed a profound astronomer.
In his ‘History of Greenland,’ he thus renders the passage we are considering:
‘There is in Vinland no winter, no cold, no frost as in Iceland or Greenland;
inasmuch as the sun, on the very day of the winter solstice (they had no dials
there), passes about six hours above the horizon.’ Having cited this passage
from Arngrim Jonas, Torfæus proceeds: ‘This meaning I had long ago given
this passage, first on the authority (if I rightly understood him) of Bryniulf
Sveinson, the most learned of all the bishops of Skalkholt, to whom I was sent,
while yet a youth, in the year 1662, with royal letters from my gracious
master, King Frederick the Third, for the purpose of learning the genuine signification
of the more difficult ancient words and phrases; and, then, from the
necessary correspondence of the time of sunset with that of sunrise.’”—(The

till half-past four in the afternoon.”—Antiq. Amer. p. 436. <i>Vide</i> Discovery

<p>The wild wheat (<i>elymus arenarius</i>) growing on the sand flats of Iceland
is thus described: “This plant, the <i>melur</i> of the natives, is a kind of grass,
with a spike or ear four or five inches long, and generally appears in a sandy
soil. The sea-shore and tracts of volcanic ashes in the interior are equally
favorable to its growth, though it is principally from the latter that the seeds
used for bread are obtained; and the natives regard it as a great gift wherewith
the wise Creator has blessed those mournful wastes. The harvest is in August,
when it becomes white in the ear, but as it is seldom fully ripe, it requires to
be dried before grinding. It is cut with a sickle, made up in bundles, and
carried home on the backs of horses. It is then separated from the straw,
and ground in hand-mills cut out of a block of lava, into fine meal of a grayish
color.”—Historical and descriptive account of Iceland, Greenland, and the

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> Concerning Marco Polo, Humboldt remarks: “Jacquet, who was unhappily
too early removed by a premature death from the investigation of
Asiatic languages, and who, like Klaproth and myself, was long occupied
with the work of the great Venetian traveller, wrote to me, as follows, shortly
before his decease: ‘I am as much struck as yourself by the composition of the
<i>Milione</i>. It is undoubtedly founded on the direct and personal observation of
the traveller, but he probably also made use of documents either officially or
privately communicated to him. Many things appear to have been borrowed
from Chinese and Mongolian works, although it is difficult to determine their
precise influence on the composition of the <i>Milione</i>; owing to the successive
translations from which Polo took his extracts. Whilst our modern travellers
are only too well pleased to occupy their readers with their personal adventures,
Marco Polo takes pains to blend his own observations with the official data communicated
to him, of which, as Governor of the city of Yangui, he was able to
have a large number.’ (See my <i>Asie Centrale</i>, t. ii. p. 395.) The compiling
method of the celebrated traveller likewise explains the possibility of his being
able to dictate his book at Genoa, in 1295, to his fellow-prisoner and friend,
Messer Rustizielo of Pisa, as if the documents had been lying before him.

<p><a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> The distance of a place, north or south of the equator, was determined by
ascertaining with the astrolabe the elevation of the pole of the heavens above
the plane of the horizon.</p>

<p>The distance of one place from another, east or west of a meridian, was
obtained by ascertaining the difference of time at the two points; the difference
of time being one hour to each space of fifteen degrees of longitude. Although
a navigator in the latter part of the fifteenth century could determine with his
astrolabe the time of the place where he was in port, from the altitude of the sun
or other heavenly bodies, the want of an accurate chronometer made it impossible
for him to know the exact time of a place elsewhere. Pigafetta, who
sailed round the world in 1519-1522, says in his treatise on navigation:
“Pilots now are satisfied with knowing the latitude, and are so presumptuous
that they refuse to hear longitude mentioned.”—MS. in Ambrosian
Library, Milan.</p>

<p>To obtain a practical solution of the difficulties which perplexed seamen in
determining the longitude of places, the Spanish government offered a thousand
crowns, in 1598, for an accurate method of ascertaining the time of distant
places. Not long afterward the government of the United Provinces of the
Netherlands offered ten thousand florins for similar information, and, in 1714,
the parliament of Great Britain passed an act proffering a gift of money to any
person who should discover the best means of ascertaining longitude.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> Cristoforo Colombo was born in the city of Genoa, about the year 1435.
His father, Dominico Colombo, was a wool-comber. The navigator married, in
Lisbon, Doña Felipa, the daughter of Bartolomeo Moñis de Perestrello, a distinguished
mariner, who had been in the service of Prince Henry of Portugal.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Columbus, in his history of the life and achievements of his father,
remarks: “So it is that some, who would cast a cloud upon his fame, say he
was of Nervi, others of Cugureo, and others of Bugiesco, all small towns near
the city of Genoa, and upon its coast. Others, who wish to exalt him, say he
was a native of Savona, others of Genoa, and others, more vain, make him of
Piacenza, in which city there are some honorable persons of his family and
tombs with the arms and inscriptions of the family of Colombi, this being the
common surname of his ancestors, though he, complying with the customs of the
country where he went to live and begin a new condition of life, altered the
word that it might be like the old name, and designated the direct from the
collateral line, calling himself Colon.... And the surname of Colon
which he revived was appropriate, which in Greek signifies a member, and his
Christian name being Christopher, designate him as being a member of Christ,
by whom salvation was conveyed to those Indian people.”—Histoire del Signore
Don Fernando Colombo. cap. 1.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> Fernando Colombo, an illegitimate son of the admiral, was born in Cordova
about the year 1487. After his father’s discovery of the New World, he
was made page to Prince Juan, the son of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.
He accompanied his father in his fourth voyage, in 1502, and after the latter’s
death, sailed twice to the West Indies. He was excellently educated, and was
the author of several works. His library, it is said, contained more than twenty
thousand books and manuscripts, which, after his death, became the property
of the cathedral of Seville. The manuscript of his history of the life of his
father was lost before the work appeared in Spanish. It is said that Luis Colon,
duke of Veragua, a dissipated grandson of the navigator, went to Genoa about
the year 1568, taking Fernando’s manuscript with him, and placed it in the hands
of Baltano de Fornari, by whom it was transferred to Giorgio Baptista Marini,
who had it translated into Italian, after which it was printed in Venice in this
language, and also in Latin. Alfonso de Ulloa’s Italian translation of it was
published, in Venice, in 1571, entitled Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo;
nelli quali s’ ha particolare, &amp; vera relatione della vita, &amp; de’ fatti dell’ Ammiraglio
D. Cristoforo Colombo, suo padre. There are several English translations
of Fernando Colombo’s history. <i>Vide</i> Collection of voyages and travels by

<p><a id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[107]</a> Columbus, in his investigations, no doubt, became informed concerning
the arguments advanced by the Greek astronomer, Anaximander, in the sixth
century before the Christian era, respecting the globular form of the earth. He
evidently read what Aristotle wrote in the fifth century of the Christian era:
“As to the figure of the earth, it must necessarily be spherical.... And,
moreover, from the visible phenomena, for if it were not so, the eclipses of the
moon would not have such sections as they have. For in the configurations in
the course of a month, the deficient part takes all different shapes; it is straight,
and concave, and convex; but in eclipses it always has the line of division convex;
wherefore, since the moon is eclipsed in consequence of the interposition
of the earth, the periphery of the earth must be the cause of this by having a
spherical form. And again, from the appearance of the stars, it is clear not only
that the earth is round, but that its size is not very great; for when we go a little
distance to the south or to the north, the circle of the horizon becomes palpably
different, so that the stars overheard undergo a great change, and are not the
same to those that travel to the north and to the south. For some stars are seen
in Egypt and at Cyprus, but are not seen in the countries north of them; and the
stars that in the north are visible while they make a complete circuit there [in
Egypt and at Cyprus], undergo a setting. So that from this it is manifest, not
only that the form of the earth is round, but also that it is not a very large sphere;
for otherwise the difference would not be so obvious to persons making so small
a change of place. Wherefore we may judge that those persons who connect the
region in the neighborhood of the Pillars of Hercules with that toward India, and
who assert that in this way the sea is one, do not assert things very improbable.
They confirm this conjecture, moreover, by elephants, which are said to be of
the same species toward each extreme of the earth, as if this circumstance was
a consequence of the conjunction of the extreme parts. The mathematicians, who
try to calculate the measure of the circumference, make it amount to 400,000
stadia; whence we infer that the earth is not only spherical, but that it is not
large compared with the magnitude of the other stars,”—De Cœlo. lib. ii.
cap. xiv.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="label">[114]</a> Claudius Ptolemæus, an Egyptian astronomer and geographer, lived, in
the second century at Alexandria. His System of Geography, (Γεωγραφική
Ἀφήγησις,) contained in eight books, was a standard work for fourteen
centuries. During the first part of the sixteenth century twenty-one editions
of the geography, with editions and emendations, were published. According to
Ptolemy, all the known part of the earth, from the first meridian, or the Canary
Islands, eastwardly, on the parallel of Rhodes, measured seventy-two thousand
stadia, or one hundred and eighty degrees, which he deemed to be the half of the
circumference of the globe. But the extent he was acquainted with was really
measured by one hundred and twenty degrees, which made the circumference
one third less than it is.</p>

<p>Marinus of Tyre, a Greek geographer, lived about 150 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> This cosmographer
supposed that the country of the Seres, or Sinae (China), the farthest
part of India known to the ancients, was fifteen hours, by the course of
the sun, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees east of the first meridian passing
through the Fortunate (Canary) Islands. According to our present geographical
measurements, the distance given by Marinus was not more than one
hundred and thirty degrees, leaving two hundred and thirty the remaining
distance from China eastwardly to the Canary Islands. Following the deductions
of Marinus, there were only one hundred and thirty-five degrees of
distance between China, going eastwardly, and the Fortunate Islands.</p>

from Myos Hormos to India, by the erroneously assumed direction of the
major axis of the Caspian from west to east, and by the over-estimation of the
length of the land route to the country of the Seres, gave the old continent a
breadth of 225°, instead of 129°. The Chinese coast was thus advanced to
the Sandwich Islands. Columbus naturally preferred this result to that of
Ptolemy, according to which Quinsay should have been found in the meridian
of the eastern part of the archipelago of the Carolinas. Ptolemy, in the Almagest
(ii. 1), places the coast of Sinae at 180°, and in his Geography (lib. i. cap.

do not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically demonstrated that
the world is of a round and spherical form, yet it does not follow that the other
side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately
follow that it is peopled. For Scripture, which proves the truth of its
historical statements by the accomplishment of its prophecies, gives no false

monstrosities, how things do not fall away from the earth on that side, they reply
that the nature of things is such that heavy bodies tend toward the centre, like
the spokes of a wheel, while light bodies, as clouds, smoke, fire, tend from the

his first voyage to the New World, and quitted its shores for the last time in
1547. His history of the Indies,—Historia general de las Indias,—written
between the years 1527 and 1562, was not printed until 1875-’76, when it was
issued, in five volumes, at Madrid. Before his death, in 1566, he gave the
manuscript of this work to the convent of San Gregorio, at Valladolid, with the
request that it should not be published for forty years. A manuscript in Las
Casas’s hand-writing, apparently an abridgment of Columbus’s journal of his
first voyage, which the former evidently had made while obtaining material for
his history of the Indies, was found by Martin Fernandez de Navarrete, the
Spanish historian, in the archives of Spain, when making, about the year 1790,
researches for information respecting the marine history of Spain.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> This island is believed by Munoz to be Watling Island; by Navarrete,
Grand Turk Island; by Humboldt and Irving, Cat Island. The Bahamas lie
between the island of Hayti or San Domingo and the east coast of Florida, or
between 21° and 27° 30´ north latitude and 70° 30´ and 79° 5´ west longitude.
The principal islands of the group are the Grand Bahama, Great and Little
Abaco, Andros, New Providence, San Salvador, Rum Cay, Great Exuma, Watling,
Long, Crooked, Atwood’s Key, Great and Little Magua islands.</p>

<p>The identity of the island is discussed at some length by Captain G. V.
Fox, of the United States Navy, who remarks: “The study that I gave to the
subject in the winter of 1878-’79 in the Bahamas, which had been familiar
cruising-ground to me, has resulted in the selection of Samana or Atwood Cay
for the first landing-place. It is a little island, 8.8 miles east and west, 1.6
extreme breadth, and averaging 1.2 north and south. It has 8.6 square miles.
The east end is in latitude 23° 05´ N.; longitude, 73° 37´ west of Greenwich....
Turk is smaller than Samana, and Cat very much longer.”—An
attempt to solve the problem of the first landing-place of Columbus in the
New World. By Captain G. V. Fox, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.

course westward, and to return to Spain, either by water, by way of Ceylon
(Taprobane) <i>rodeando todo la tierra de los Negros</i>, or by land, through Jerusalem
and Jaffa.’ ... See the important manuscript of Andres Bernaldez, Cura

<p><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a> The argument of Las Casas concerning the heat at forty-two degrees
north latitude is invalidated by Columbus’s reasons for not sailing farther to the
north. In his letter to Rafael Sanchez he says: “Finding myself proceeding
toward the north, which I was desirous to avoid <i>on account of the cold</i>, and,
moreover, meeting with a contrary wind, I determined to return to the south.”
It would seem that Columbus was unable to satisfy his own doubts respecting
the latitude of the places in the North to which he had sailed. If he had not
mentioned that he was in doubt respecting the working condition of his quadrant,
the question of his sailing as far north as the forty-second parallel would
be an important matter for geographical discussion. Navarrete says: “The
quadrants of that time measured the double altitude, and consequently the
forty-two degrees which Columbus says he was distant from the equator are to
be reduced to twenty-one north latitude, which is the parallel to which he had
sailed.”—<i>Vide</i> Coleccion de los viages y descubrimientos. Navarrete, tom. i.

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> Columbus writing from Española in October, 1498, says: “Each time
that I sail from Spain to India, as soon as I have proceeded about a hundred
nautical miles to the west of the Azores, I perceive an extraordinary alteration
in the movement of the heavenly bodies, in the temperature of the air, and in
the character of the sea. I have observed these alterations with especial care,
and I notice that the mariner’s compass, whose declination had hitherto been
northeast, was now changed to northwest; and when I had crossed this line, as
if in passing the brow of a hill, I found the ocean covered with such a mass of
sea-weed, similar to small branches of pine covered with pistachio nuts, that we
were apprehensive that for want of a sufficiency of water our ships would run upon
a shoal. Before we reached the line of which I speak, there was no trace of any
such sea-weed. On the boundary line, one hundred miles west of the Azores,
the ocean is found still and calm, being scarcely ever moved by a breeze. On
my passage from the Canary Islands to the parallel of Sierra Leone, we had
to endure a frightful degree of heat, but as soon as we had crossed the above-mentioned
line, the climate changed, the air became temperate, and the freshness
increased the farther we proceeded.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that the extract from the third voyage is but an amplification
of his first account, and expresses his conviction that west of the Azores, where
the declination was a little easterly, it changed to the westward, being nearly
zero at Corvo, and gradually increasing to one point or 11° W., at a distance of
300 nautical miles W. of the longitude of Corvo. The position of Rosario on
the S.E. part of the island of Corvo is, according to the <i>Carta Esferica de las
Islas Azores</i>, Madrid, 1855, in latitude 39° 41´ and longitude 24° 53´ west of
San Fernando, or in 31° 07´ west of Greenwich (according to the <i>Conn. des
Temps</i>), 100 leagues or 300 nautical miles west of this longitude would correspond
(in latitude 28°) to 5° 40´, and would bring the Columbus line in longitude
36° 47´ W.”—An inquiry into the variation of the compass off the Bahama
Islands at the land fall of Columbus in 1492. By Charles A. Schott. p. 51.</p>

<p>“The necessity for attaching a special and well-informed astronomer to
every great expedition was so generally felt that Queen Isabella wrote to Columbus
on the 5th of September, 1493, ‘that although he had shown in his undertakings
that he knew more than any other living being (<i>que ninguno de los nacidos</i>),
she counselled him, nevertheless, to take with him Fray Antonio de
Marchena, as being a learned and skillful astronomer.’ Columbus writes in the
narrative of his fourth voyage that ‘there was only one infallible method of
taking a ship’s reckoning, viz., that employed by astronomers. He who understands
it may rest satisfied; for that which it yields is like unto a prophetic
vision (<i>vision profetica</i>). Our ignorant pilots, when they have lost sight of land
for several days know not where they are. They would not be able to find the
countries again which I have discovered. To navigate a ship requires the compass
(<i>compas y arte</i>) and the knowledge or art of the astronomer.’”—Humboldt:

<p><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213" class="label">[213]</a> Columbus, in his letter to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, from
Jamaica, dated July 7, 1503, says: “This is the account I have to give of my
voyage. The men who accompanied me were a hundred and fifty in number,
among whom were many considered to be pilots and good sailors, but none of
them can explain whither I went nor whence I came. The explanation is
simply this: I sailed from a point above the port of Brazil, and while I was in
Española, a storm prevented me from following my intended route, for I was
compelled to go wherever the wind drove me. At the same time I became very
sick, and there was no one who had sailed in these parts before. However,
after some days the wind and sea became tranquil, but there were rapid currents.
I put into a harbor at the island called Isla de las Bocas, and afterward steered
for Tierra-firme. However, it is impossible to give a correct account of all our
movements, for I was carried away by the current for many days without
seeing land.</p>

<p>“I ascertained, notwithstanding, by the compass and by observation, that I
was running parallel with the coast of Tierra-firme. No one could tell under
what part of the heavens we were, nor at what time I changed my course for
the island of Española. The pilots thought we had arrived at the island of St.
John, whereas it was the land of Mango, four hundred leagues westward of the
place mentioned by them. Let them answer and say if they know where
Veragua is situated. I assert that they can give no other information than that
they went to lands where there was plenty of gold, and this they can surely
affirm; but they do not know the way to return there for it. They would be
obliged to go on a voyage of discovery as if they had never been there before.
There is a way of reckoning [the course and distance sailed] derived from
astronomy which is trustworthy and safe, and a sufficient guide to any one who
understands it. This resembles prophetic vision.</p>

<p>“The vessels of India do not sail except with the wind abaft. This is done,
not because they are badly built or clumsy, but because the strong currents in
those parts, together with the wind, make it impracticable for them to sail with
the bowline (<i>con bolina</i>), for in one day they would lose as much way as they
might have made in seven. For a similar reason I could not use caravels,
even though they were Portuguese lateens. This is the reason for their [the
vessels of India] not sailing except with a favorable wind, and they will sometimes
remain in port, waiting for one, seven or eight months at a time, nor is
this particularly strange, for the same occurs often in Spain.”—<i>Vide</i> Select letters
of Christopher Columbus. Major.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_216" href="#FNanchor_216" class="label">[216]</a> Pietro Martire d’Anghiera, commonly called Peter Martyr, a descendant
of an illustrious Milanese family originally from Anghiera, on the eastern shore
of Lake Maggiore, in upper Italy, was born in 1455 at Arona, on the western
border of the lake. He was carried to the baptismal font by a friar of the
Dominican order and christened with the name of Peter, that of the martyr of
1252, whose feast-day falls on the twenty-ninth of April. In 1477, he went to
Rome to fit himself for the priesthood. There he became acquainted with the
Castilian embassador, the Count of Tendilla, and was induced to return with him
to Spain, in 1487. From King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella he received a
number of honoring commissions. He followed the royal standard through
two campaigns. In 1501 he was sent to Egypt to conciliate the sultan. He
returned to Spain in August, 1502. The mission to Egypt furnished him with
some of the material for his Latin work, entitled: “P. Martyris Angli Mediolanensis
opera Legatio Babylonica, Oceani decas, poemata, epigrammata.”
In 1505 he was made prior of the cathedral of Granada. Pope Leo X.
honored him with the office of apostolical prothonotary. As a royal counsellor
in the affairs of the Indies he acquired a very extensive range of information
respecting the early voyages of discovery made to the New World. His work:
“De Orbe Novo Petri Martyris ab Angleria Mediolanensis protonotarij Cesaris
senatoris decades,” contains valuable historical matter. His letters, eight hundred
and more, in the collection entitled “Opus epistolarum,” the first dated
January 1, 1488, the last May, 1525, throw considerable light upon the numerous
facts relating to the voyages of Columbus and other navigators of his time.
His “Legatio Babylonica” was first printed at Seville (Hispalis) in 1511; his
“De Orbe Novo” and letters at Alcala (Complutum) in 1530. He died in 1525,
and was entombed in the cathedral of Grenada.</p>

took up his abode in a desert, near a rapid stream, over which he carried travellers
on his back. While bearing, one day, a child across the swollen flood,
he discovered that it was the Christ, hence his name Christophorus, the
Christ-bearer.</p>

<p>Speaking of his father’s name, Ferdinand Columbus remarks: “As St.
Christopher is reported to have received that name because he carried Christ
over the deep waters with great danger to himself, whence came the name of
Christopher, and as he conveyed over the people whom no other could have
carried, so Admiral Christophorus Colonus, imploring the assistance of Christ
in that dangerous voyage, went over safely himself and his company, that those
Indian nations might become citizens and inhabitants of the church triumphant
in heaven.”—Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo. cap. i.</p>

βάκὴλος, a large, lusty fellow. Names similar to this appellation were used
by the Greeks as early as the third century of the Christian era. Athenæus, in
his work entitled Δειπνοσοφισταί (the learned men at supper), presents
this information respecting certain fish: “They say that they are usually caught
in couples, and that one is always found following at the tail of the other; and,
therefore, from the fact of one following close on the tail of the other, some
ancients call men who are intemperate and libidinous by the same name....
Euthydemus, in his work on Cured Fish, says: ‘Some call this fish [the cod]
the <i>bacchus</i>, and some the <i>gelaria</i>, and some the hake.’”—The Deipnosophists

<p>Great numbers of the common cod [<i>morrhua vulgaris</i>] are annually caught
on the fishing-banks off the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. This fish
is very prolific. It is said that eight millions of eggs have been counted in the
roe of a female cod. Cod are sometimes caught that weigh ninety pounds.</p>

remarkable interest in geography and navigation, and for a time held a professor’s
chair of these branches at Oxford. In 1582 his “Divers voyages touching
the discouerie of America and Ilands adiacent vnto the same,” was published
in London. He was also the author of “A particular discourse concerninge the
greate necessitie and manifolde comodyties that are like to growe to this Realme
of England by the Westerne discoueries lately attempted, written in the year
1584.” In 1589, he published his celebrated work, entitled: The principal
navigations, voiages, and discoveries of the English nation, made by sea or
ouer Land, to the most remote and farthest distant quarters of the earth at any
time within the compasse of these 1500 yeeres. Deuided into three Seuerall

<p>Herodotus, speaking of the designations of the other divisions of the earth,
says: “Nor can I conjecture for what reason these different names have been
given to the earth, which is one, and those derived from the names of women....
Nor can I learn the names of those who made this division, nor
whence they derived the appellations. Libya [Africa] is said by most of the
Greeks to take its name from a native woman of the name of Libya; and Asia,
from the wife of Prometheus. But the Lydians claim this name, saying that
Asia was called after Asius, son of Cotys, son of Manes, and not after Asia,
the wife of Prometheus; from whom also a tribe of Sardis is called the
Asian tribe. Whether Europe, then, is surrounded by water is known by no
man, nor is it clear whence it received this name, nor who gave it, unless we
will say that the region received the name from the Tyrian Europa, and that it
was previously without a name like other regions, for she evidently belonged to
Asia, and never came into the country which is now called Europe by the
Grecians, and only passed from Phœnicia to Crete, and from Crete to Lycia.”—Herodotus:
Melpomene xlv.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_295" href="#FNanchor_295" class="label">[295]</a> Until recently the map made by Petrus Apianus (Peter Benewitz), in the
Polyhistor of C. Julius Solinus, printed in Vienna, in 1520, was supposed to be
the earliest on which the name of America was engraved. However, the discovery,
in France, in 1880, of a copy of the “Cosmographiae introductio,”
printed by Jean de la Place, without a title or colophon-date, containing a map
of the world, supposed to have been made by Ludovicus Boulenger, between the
years 1514 and 1520, disentitled the former to its celebrity. The map is divided
into twelve sections or gores which can be cut and pasted on a globe. The
represented territory of North and South America is shown in two divisions,
separated by a large body of water, between the tenth and twentieth parallels
of north latitude. The word “Nova” appears on the northern division; and
on the southern, “America noviter reperta.” A similar inscription it is said is
on a cartographic representation of the world, in Vienna, made in 1509: “<i>Une
semblable appellation se lit sur la projection, également imprimée en fuseaux, d’un
globe terrestre à la date de 1509 qui fait partie de la collectione de M. le

Santa Marta, and took in water there.</p>

<p>“On Friday, the thirteenth of May, they sailed along a shoal and a row of
islands as far as the island which they called Pola, lying in twenty-six degrees

spacious sea, like a bay.</p>

<p>“On Sunday, the day of the Feast of the Holy Spirit, the fifteenth of May,
they coasted ten leagues along a row of small islands as far as two white ones,
and they called them all the Martyrs, (las Martires), because the high rocks, at
a distance, look like men suffering, and the name has suited them well on account
of the large number of persons who have since been lost there. The rocks lie
in twenty-six degrees fifteen minutes. The ships held on, sometimes north and
sometimes northeast, until the twenty-third of May; and on the twenty-fourth
they ran along the coast to the southward as far as some small islands which

this land there was a sea ‘which in less than nine days’ sail would bear ships to
the <i>Chersonesus aurea</i> of Ptolemy and to the mouth of the Ganges.’ In the
same <i>Carta rarissima</i>, which contains the beautiful and poetic narration of a
dream, the admiral says that ‘the opposite coasts of Veragua, near the Rio de
Belen, are situated relatively to another, as Tortosa on the Mediterranean and
Fuenterabia in Biscay, or as Venice and Pisa.’ The great ocean, the South
Pacific, was even at that time regarded as merely a continuation of the <i>Sinus
magnus</i> (μέγας κόλπος) of Ptolemy, situated before the golden Chersonesus,
whilst Cattigara and the land of the Sines (Thinae) were supposed to constitute
its eastern boundary.”—Humboldt: Cosmos. Otté’s trans. vol. ii. pp. 642, 643.</p>

the size of a carriage-wheel, representing the sun, the entire plate being of the
finest gold and of the most beautiful workmanship,—a most extraordinary work
of art, which, according to the account of those who weighed it, was worth more
than twenty thousand <i>pesos de oro</i>. The second was a disk, even larger than
the former, of massive silver, representing the moon, with rays and figures on
it, and of great value. The third was a casque, filled with grains of pure gold
as they were found in the mine, worth about three thousand <i>pesos</i>, which gold
was of more importance to us than if it had been ten times this value, for we
were now assured that there were rich gold-mines in the country. Among the
other presents there were thirty golden ducks in every way resembling the living
fowl, very elaborately made. Besides, there were figures of lions, tigers, dogs,
and monkeys. There were also ten chains with lockets, all of gold, and of the
most costly workmanship; a bow with the string and twelve arrows; two staffs
like those used by justices, five palms in length; all of which were made of the
purest gold. They also brought small cases containing the most beautiful green
feathers, interwoven with gold and silver, and fans similarly made, and figures
of all kinds of game made of gold.”</p>

<p>Peter Martyr, who had inspected the presents, says: “<i>Si quid unquam
honoris humana ingenia in huiuscemodi artibus sunt adepta, principatum iure
merito ista consequentur. Aurum, gemmasque non admiror quidem, qua industria,

went with Pamfilo de Narvaez to New Spain, who was sent there by Diego
Velasquez to administer the affairs of that country. When Ayllon landed in
Mexico he became so inimical to the purposes of Velasquez that Narvaez put

Yamiscaron, Carixagusignanin and Anoxa, that were said to lie between the
thirty-fifth and thirty-seventh parallels of north latitude. In 1524 it is said
that he sent two ships to some of these places. In July, 1526, he sailed himself
from Española, with six vessels, having on board five hundred men and
ninety horses. Diego Miruelo, the pilot of this fleet, it is said, failed to find
the coast of Chicora, which he had visited in 1520. The natives, where the
Spaniards landed, manifested toward them the greatest friendliness, and so deceived
Ayllon with their unbounded hospitality that he sent two hundred of his
men into the interior on an exploring expedition. While they were sleeping
the savages fell upon them and murdered them to a man. They then attacked
those near the ships, who, being outnumbered, fled before their assailants.
One hundred and fifty escaped, and in a suffering condition returned to San

<p>“I wrote not to your Maiesty, most Christian King, since the time we
suffered the Tempest in the North partes, of the successe of the foure shippes,
which your Maiestie sent forth to discouer new lands by the Ocean, thinking
your Maiestie had bene already duely enformed thereof. Now by these presents
I will give your Maiestie to understand how by the violence of the Windes
we were forced with the two shippes, the Norman and the Dolphin (in such
euill case as they were), to land in Britaine. Where after wee had repayred
them in all poynts as was needful, and armed them very well, we took our
course along the coast of Spaine, which your Maiestie shall understand by the
profite that we receiued thereby. Afterwards with the Dolphin alone we determined
to make discouerie of new Countries, to prosecute the Nauigation we
had already begun, which I purpose at the present to recount unto to your
Maiestie, to make manifest the whole proceeding of the matter.</p>

<p>“The 17 of January, the yeere 1524, by the Grace of God, we departed
from the dishabited rocke by the isle of Madeira (<i>Alli, 17. Genaro, 1524. Dio
gratia partimmo dallo scoglio dishabitato</i>), appertaining to the king of Portugal,
with 50 men, with victuals, weapons, and other ship-munition very well prouided
and furnished for eight months; and sailing Westward with a faire Easterly
winde (<i>per Ponente nauigando con vento di Leuante assai piaceuole</i>), in 25
dayes we ran 500 leagues, and the 20 of Februarie (<i>alli 20 Febraro</i>), we were
ouertaken with as sharpe and terrible a tempest as euer any saylers suffered,
whereof with the diuine helpe and mercifull assistance of Almighty God, and
the goodnesse of our shippe, accompanied with the good happe of her fortunate

<p><a id="Footnote_377" href="#FNanchor_377" class="label">[377]</a> In Verrazzano’s geographical explanation of the voyage, he assigns 62½
miles to a degree and 4 miles to a marine league. According to this <i>data</i>, 15⅝
marine leagues equal a degree. On Thevet’s map of the fourth part of the
world, printed in 1575, is a scale of leagues which shows that a marine league
was double the length of a French league. With this information it is easy to
ascertain the length of a degree in French leagues of Verrazzano’s day; 31¼,
according to his explanation, equalling a degree. Columbus made 56⅔ miles
equal an equinoctial degree and 60 miles equal to 15 leagues. Pigafetta assigned
17½ leagues to a degree. “The land-league is three miles,” he says, “the
sea-league is four.” The modern nautical league is one-twentieth of a degree,
or three equatorial miles or 3.45785 statute miles. A sea-mile, according to the
United States standard, is equal to 1.152664 common statute or land-miles.
One degree of longitude at the equator is equal to 69.160 land-miles. A French
geographical league, according to Verrazzano’s reckoning, equals 2⅕ land-miles
of the United States standard.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_409" href="#FNanchor_409" class="label">[409]</a> “This distance,” he remarks, “calculated geometrically upon the ratio
that three and one seventh times the diameter of a circle is equal to its circumference,
gives 92⁵⁴¹⁶⁴⁄₄₇₂₇₃₃ degrees. For if we take 114⁶⁄₁₁ degrees as the chord of
an arc of a great circle, we have by the same ratio 95²⁴⁸³⁄₄₉₅₀ degrees as the chord
of an arc on the parallel of 34°, being that on which we first made land, and
300²³³⁄₁₅₇₅ degrees as the circumference of the whole circle, passing through this
plane. Allowing then, as actual observations show, that 62½ terrestrial miles
correspond to a celestial degree, we find the whole circumference of 300²³³⁄₁₅₇₅
degrees, as just given, to be 18,759³¹⁄₁₂₆ miles, which, divided by 360, makes the
length of a degree of longitude on the parallel of 34° to be 52⁹⁸⁹⁄₉₀₇₂ miles, and
that is the true measure. Therefore, by a right line to the said rock which
stands in 32°, we have to calculate the distance, the said 1,200 leagues which
we have found, from the thirty-fourth parallel, from west to east, hence I
should have run 92⁵⁴¹⁶⁴⁄₄₇₂₇₃₃ degrees, and this many therefore we have sailed to
the West, which was not known to the ancients.”</p>

<p>114⁶⁄₁₁ × 3¹⁄₇ = 360. 300²³³⁄₁₅₇₅ × 7 ÷ 22 = 95²⁴⁸³⁄₄₉₅₀. 300²³³⁄₁₅₇₅ × 62½ = 18,759³¹⁄₁₂₆. 18,759³¹⁄₁₂₆
÷ 560 = 52⁹⁸⁹⁄₉₀₇₂. 4,800 by 52⁹⁸⁹⁄₉₀₇₂ = 92⁵⁴¹⁶⁴⁄₄₇₂₇₃₃.</p>

still found land. Turning about they steered northward on the same meridian
and along the coast to the eighth parallel, and then along the coast more to the
west, and north to the latitude of 21° [31°?], without finding a termination to the
continent. They estimated the distance run as 89²⁹⁷⁰⁹/₄₆₇₈₁ which added to the
20³²⁰⁶⁰/₄₇₂₈₁ first run make 110¹⁴⁴⁸⁸/₄₆₇₈₁, but this may vary somewhat from the truth.
We did not make this voyage, and therefore cannot speak from experience.
We calculated it geometrically from the observations furnished by many navigators,
who have made the voyage and affirm the distance to be 1600 leagues, due
allowance being made for the deviations of the ship from a straight course by
reason of contrary winds. I hope that we shall now obtain accurate information
on these points, by new voyages to be made on the same coasts.”—<i>Vide</i>

<p>Samuel de Champlain, the French explorer, describing in 1632 the coast of
America in the vicinity of St. John’s River, New Brunswick, writes: “I was at
four islands near the river St. John.... Farther west there are other islands,
one of which extends six leagues, which is called by the savages, <i>Menane</i>.”

of March, 1512. Mercator is the Latinized form of his German name, <i>Kremer</i>,
a tradesman, merchant. After studying at Bois-le-Duc, in Brabant, he entered
the university of Louvain. He selected for his profession the manufacture of
mathematical instruments and the art of drawing and engraving. His cartographic
fame began with the engraving of a map of Palestine, in 1537. Next
followed a map of Flanders, in 1540. Then in 1541, a large terrestrial globe,
which he dedicated to the “<i>Illustriss Dno Nicolao Perrenoto, Domino à Granuella</i>”;
the original drawings of which are preserved in the Royal library of
Belgium, in Brussels. In 1552, Mercator removed from Louvain to Duisburg,
where, in 1569, he made his famous map of the world. He died in December,
1594.</p>
